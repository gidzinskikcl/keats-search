00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,150
PROFESSOR: So today we'll be
continuing along the theme

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,320
of risk stratification.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,430
I'll spend the first half
to 2/3 of today's lecture

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,010
continuing where we
left off last week

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,230
before the discussion.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,287
I'll talk about how does
one derive the labels

12
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:31,370
that one uses within a
supervised machine learning

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,270
approach.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,610
I'll continue talking
about how one evaluates

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,253
risk stratification models.

16
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,420
And then I'll talk about
some of the subtleties that

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,770
arise when you
want to use machine

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,353
learning for health
care, specifically

19
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:42,530
for risk stratification.

20
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,947
And I think that's
going to be one

21
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:46,070
of the most interesting
parts of today's lecture.

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,630
In the last third
of today's lecture,

23
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,040
I'll be talking about
how one can rethink

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,820
the supervised machine
learning problem,

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,750
not to be a
classification problem,

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,320
but be something closer
to a regression problem.

27
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,900
And one now thinks about not
will someone, for example,

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,420
develop diabetes within one
to three years from now,

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,340
but when precisely will
they develop diabetes--

30
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,750
so the time to event.

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,300
Then one has to start to
really think very carefully

32
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,660
about the censoring issues
that I alluded to last week.

33
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,490
And so I'll formalize
those notions

34
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,302
in the language of
survival modeling.

35
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,510
And I'll talk about how one
can do maximum likelihood

36
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,960
estimation in that setting, and
how one should do evaluation

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,627
in that setting.

38
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,780

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,570
So in our lecture
last week, I gave you

40
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,820
this example of risk
stratification for type 2

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,990
diabetes.

42
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,660
The goal, just to remind
you, was as follows.

43
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,000
25% of people in
the United States

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,970
have undiagnosed
type 2 diabetes.

45
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,850
If we could take
health insurance claims

46
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,950
data that's available
for everyone

47
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,170
who has health
insurance, and use

48
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,040
that to predict who, in the
near-term-- next one to three

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,360
years-- is likely to be newly
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,

50
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,910
then we could use it to
risk-stratify patient

51
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,540
population.

52
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,030
We could use that, then, to
figure out who is most at risk,

53
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,620
do interventions
for those patients,

54
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,260
to try to get them diagnosed
and get them started

55
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,080
on treatment if relevant.

56
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,669
But what I didn't
talk much about

57
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,380
was where did those
labels come from.

58
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,277
How do we know that someone had
a diabetes onset in that window

59
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:19,610
that I show up there on the top?

60
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,520

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,870
So what are the answers?

62
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,490
I mean, all of you should have
read the paper by Razavian.

63
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,670
And then also you should
hopefully have some ideas.

64
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,630
Thoughts?

65
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,410
A hint-- it was in
supplementary material.

66
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,630

67
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,230
How did we define a
positive case in that paper?

68
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:48,120

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,713
Yep.

70
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:49,520
AUDIENCE: Drugs they were on.

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,770
PROFESSOR: Drugs they were on.

72
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,860
OK, yeah, so for example,
metformin, glucose--

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,975
sorry, insulin.

74
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:00,620
AUDIENCE: I think they did
include metformin actually.

75
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,550
PROFESSOR: Metformin
is a tricky case.

76
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,320
Because metformin is often used
for alternative indications.

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,570
But there are many
medications, such as insulin,

78
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,230
which are used pretty
exclusively for treating

79
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,950
diabetes.

80
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,920
And so you can look
to see, does a patient

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,030
have a record of taking one
of these diabetic medications

82
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,590
in that window that we're
using to define the outcome?

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,480
If you see a record
of a medication,

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,680
you might conjecture, this
patient probably has diabetes.

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,170
But what about it they don't
have any medication listed

86
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,610
in that time window?

87
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,470
What could you conclude then?

88
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,720
Any ideas?

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,220
Yeah.

90
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,660
AUDIENCE: If you look
at the HBA1C value,

91
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,510
and you know the normal range,
and if you see the [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,950
above like 7.5 or 7.

93
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,260
PROFESSOR: So you're giving
me an alternative approach,

94
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,540
not looking at medications,
but looking at laboratory test

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,040
results.

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,080
Look at their HBA1C
results, which

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,070
measures approximately an
average of three-month glucose

98
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,120
values.

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,460
And if that's out of range,
then they're diabetic.

100
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,530
And that's, in
fact, usually used

101
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,020
as a definition of diabetes.

102
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,490
But that didn't answer
my original question.

103
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,090
Why is just looking at diabetic
medications not enough?

104
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,394

105
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,282
AUDIENCE: Some of the
diabetic medications

106
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,297
can be used to treat
other conditions.

107
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:23,880
PROFESSOR: Sometimes
there's ambiguity

108
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,475
in diabetic medications.

109
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,850
But we've sort of
dealt with that

110
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,610
already by trying to
choose an unambiguous set.

111
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,397
What are other reasons?

112
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,730
AUDIENCE: You're starting
with the medicine at the onset

113
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,887
of diabetes [INAUDIBLE].

114
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,970
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's a
really interesting point--

115
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,220
not the one I was thinking
about, but I like it--

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,010
which is that a patient might
have been diagnosed with type 2

117
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,135
diabetes, but they,
for whatever reason,

118
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:49,260
in that communication
between provider and patient,

119
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,050
they decided we're not going
to start treatment yet.

120
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,800
So they might not yet be
on treatment for diabetes,

121
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,640
yet the whole health
care system might

122
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
be very well aware that
the patient is diabetic,

123
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,370
in which case doing these
interventions for that patient

124
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,787
might be irrelevant.

125
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:04,620
Yep, another reason?

126
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,328
AUDIENCE: So a lot of
people are just not

127
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:07,530
diagnosed for diabetes.

128
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,200
So they have it.

129
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,280
So one label means that
they have diabetes,

130
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,665
and the other label is a
combination of people who

131
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,453
have and don't have diabetes.

132
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,870
PROFESSOR: So the
point was, often

133
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,448
you just might not be
diagnosed for diabetes.

134
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,990
That, unfortunately,
is not something

135
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,640
that we're going to
able to solve here.

136
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,292
It is an issue, but we
have no solution for it.

137
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,750
No, rather there's a different
point that I want to get at,

138
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,950
which is that this
data has biases in it.

139
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,160
So even if a patient is
on a diabetes medication,

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,500
for whatever reason--
maybe they are paying

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
cash for those medications.

142
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,910
If they're paying cash
for those medications,

143
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,520
then there's not going to be any
record for the patient taking

144
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,730
those medications in the
health insurance claims.

145
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,895
Because the health insurer
didn't have to pay for it.

146
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:53,520
But the reason that you gave is
also a very interesting reason.

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
And both of them are valid.

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
So for all of these reasons,
just looking at the medications

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
alone is going to
be insufficient.

150
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,200
And as was just
suggested a moment ago,

151
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
looking at other indicators,
like, for example,

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,900
does the patient have an
abnormal blood glucose value

153
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,640
or HBA1C value would
also provide information.

154
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,077
So it's non-trivial, right?

155
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:15,660
And part of what you're going
to be doing in your next problem

156
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,120
set, problem set 2, is going
to be thinking through how

157
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,060
does one actually do this cohort
construction, not just what

158
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,650
is your inclusion/exclusion
criteria,

159
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,080
but also how do you
really derive those labels

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
from that data set.

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,350
Now the traditional answer
to this has two steps to it.

162
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,800
Step 1 is to actually
manually label some patients.

163
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,530
So you take a few
hundred patients,

164
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,050
and you go through their data.

165
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,660
You actually look at
their data, and decide,

166
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,650
is this patient diabetic
or are they not diabetic?

167
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,150
And the reason why you have to
do that is because often what

168
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,680
you might think of is obvious--

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,830
like, oh, if they're on diabetes
medication, they're diabetic--

170
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,060
has flaws to it.

171
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,290
And until you really dig
down and look at the data,

172
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,200
you might not recognize that
that criteria has a flaw in it.

173
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
So that chart review is
really an essential part

174
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,272
of this process.

175
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,730
Then the second
step is, how do you

176
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,400
generalize to get that
label now for everyone

177
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,618
in your population.

178
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:11,910
And again, there, there are
usually two different types

179
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,090
of approaches.

180
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,380
The first approach is to
come up with some simple rule

181
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,970
to try to then
extrapolate to everyone.

182
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,830
For example, if they have,
A, diabetes medication,

183
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,140
or an abnormal lab
test result, that

184
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,820
would be an example of a rule.

185
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,970
And then you could then
apply that to everyone.

186
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,470
But even those rules can
be really tricky to derive.

187
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,990
And I'll show you some examples
of that in just a moment.

188
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,700
And as we know,
machine learning is

189
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,850
sometimes good as an alternative
for coming up with a rule.

190
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,320
So there's often now
a second approach

191
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,260
to this being more
and more commonly used

192
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,140
in the literature, which is to
actually use machine learning

193
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,783
itself to derive the labels.

194
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:56,700
And this is a bit subtle,
because it's machine

195
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,020
learning for machine learning.

196
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,095
So I want to break that
down for one second.

197
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:02,970
When you're trying to
derive the labels, what

198
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,390
you want to know
is not, at time T,

199
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,120
what's going to happen at
time T plus W and onwards--

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,010
that's the original
machine learning task

201
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,750
that we set out to solve--

202
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,920
but rather, given
everything you know

203
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,060
about the patient,
including the future data,

204
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,090
is this patient newly diagnosed
with diabetes in that window

205
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,700
that I show in black there,
between T plus W and onward.

206
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,250
OK?

207
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,943
So for example, this
machine learning problem,

208
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,360
this new machine
learning problem,

209
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,450
could take, as input, lab
test results, and medications,

210
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,190
and a whole bunch of other data.

211
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,230
And you then use the few
examples you labeled in step 1

212
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,870
to try to predict, is
this patient currently

213
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,347
diabetic or not.

214
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:45,930
You then use that
model to extrapolate

215
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,930
to the whole population.

216
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,990
And now you have
your outcome label.

217
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,550
It might be a little
bit imperfect,

218
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,383
but hopefully it's much
better than what you

219
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,700
could have gotten with a rule.

220
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,710
And then, now
using those outcome

221
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,877
labels, you solve your original
machine learning problem.

222
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:00,460
Is that clear?

223
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,960
Any questions?

224
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,930
AUDIENCE: I have one.

225
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,555
PROFESSOR: Yep.

226
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,400
AUDIENCE: How do you
evaluate yourself then,

227
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,817
if you have these
labels that were

228
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,255
produced with machine learning,
which are probabilistic?

229
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,880
PROFESSOR: So that's where this
first step is really important.

230
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,000
You've got to get
ground truth somehow.

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,210
And of course once you
get that ground truth,

232
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,798
you create a train-and-validate
set of that ground truth.

233
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:24,340
You run your machine learning
algorithm with the trained one.

234
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,882
You'd look at its
performance metrics

235
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:29,260
on that validate set for the
label prediction problem.

236
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,043
And that's how you
get confidence in it.

237
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:32,960
But let's try to break
this down a little bit.

238
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,402
So first of all, what does this
chart review step look like?

239
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,110
Well, if it's an
electronic health record

240
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,335
system, what you often do is you
will pull up Epic, or Cerner,

241
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,727
or whatever the
commercial EHR system is.

242
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,060
And you will actually start
looking at the patient data.

243
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,058
You'll read notes written
by previous doctors

244
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:48,850
about this patient.

245
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,642
And you'll look at
their blood test results

246
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:52,503
across time, medications
that they're on.

247
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,920
And from that you
can usually tell

248
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,535
pretty coherent story what's
going on with your patient.

249
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,660
Of course even better-- or
the best way to get data

250
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,210
is to do a prospective study.

251
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,520
So you actually have a
research assistant standing

252
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,010
in the room when a patient
walks into a provider.

253
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,100
And they talk to the
patient, and they take down

254
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,910
really very clear notes
what this patient has,

255
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,930
what they don't have.

256
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,138
But that's usually too
expensive to do prospectively.

257
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:18,925
So usually what we do is
do this retrospectively.

258
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,300
Now, if you're working with
health insurance claims data,

259
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,710
you usually don't have the
luxury of looking at notes.

260
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,430
And so what, in my group, we
type typically do is we build,

261
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,770
actually, a visualization tool.

262
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,690
And by the way, I'm a
machine learning person.

263
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,060
I don't know anything
about visualization.

264
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,460
Neither do I claim
to be good at it.

265
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,430
But you can't do the machine
learning work unless you really

266
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,600
understand your data.

267
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,570
So we had to build this tool
in order to look at the data,

268
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,240
in order to try to do that
first step of understanding,

269
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,435
did we even characterize
diabetes correctly.

270
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:49,810
So I'm not going
go deep into it.

271
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,250
By the way, you
can download this.

272
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,530
It's an open source tool.

273
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,910
But ballpark what I'm showing
you here is one patient's data.

274
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm showing on
this x-axis, time,

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,450
going from April to December.

276
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,180
And on the y-axis, I'm showing
events as they occurred.

277
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,690
So in orange are
diagnosis codes that

278
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,130
were recorded for the patient.

279
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,960
In green are procedure codes.

280
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,030
In blue are laboratory tests.

281
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,060
And if you see, on a
given line, multiple dots

282
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,790
along that same line, it
means that same lab test

283
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,138
was performed multiple times.

284
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,430
And you could click on it to
see what the results were.

285
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,780
And in this way, you could start
to tell a coherent story what's

286
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,905
going on with your patient.

287
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:28,480
All right, so tools
like this is what

288
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,897
you're going to
need to able to do

289
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,410
that first step from something
like health insurance claims

290
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,180
data.

291
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,910
Now, traditionally,
that first step,

292
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,440
which then leads you to
label some data, and then,

293
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,470
from there, you go and
come up with these rules,

294
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,810
or do a machine learning
algorithm to get the label,

295
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,850
usually that's a
paper in itself.

296
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,392
Of course, not of interest to
the computer science community,

297
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,860
but of extreme interest to
the health care community.

298
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,830
So usually there's a first
paper, academic paper,

299
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,653
which evaluates this process
for deriving the label,

300
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,070
and then there are much later
papers which talk about what

301
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,487
you could do with that label,
such as the machine learning

302
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,790
problem we originally
set out to solve.

303
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,540
So let's look at an example
of one of those rules.

304
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,760
Here is a rule, to derive
from health insurance claims

305
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,250
data whether a patient
has type 2 diabetes.

306
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,910
Now, this isn't quite the same
one that we used in that paper,

307
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,658
but it gets the idea across.

308
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,950
First you look to see, did
the patient have a diagnosis

309
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,245
code for type 1 diabetes.

310
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:34,780

311
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,990
If the answer is
no, you continue.

312
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,080
If the answer is yes,
you've sort of ruled out.

313
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,290
Because you say, OK, this
patient's abnormal blood test

314
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,520
results are because they
have type 1 diabetes, not

315
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,260
type 2 diabetes.

316
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,110
Type 1 diabetes
usually is what you

317
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,820
can think of as
juvenile diabetes,

318
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,480
is diagnosed much earlier.

319
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,448
And there's a different
mechanism behind it.

320
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:56,740
Then you look at other things--

321
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,900
OK, is there a
diagnosis code for type

322
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,920
2 diabetes somewhere
in the patient's data?

323
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
If so, you go to the
right, and you look to see,

324
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,350
is there a medication,
an Rx, for type

325
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,480
1 diabetes in the data.

326
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,620
If the answer is no, you
continue down this way.

327
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,030
If the answer is
yes, you go this way.

328
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,520
A yes of a type 1
diabetes medication

329
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,440
doesn't alone rule
out the patient.

330
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,030
Because maybe the
same medications

331
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,770
are used for type
1 as for type 2.

332
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,860
So there's some other
things you need to do there.

333
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,360
Right, you can see that this
starts to really quickly become

334
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,650
complicated.

335
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,830
And these manual-based
approaches

336
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,362
end up having pretty
bad positive--

337
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,320
so they're designed
usually to have pretty high

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,550
positive predictive value.

339
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,490
But they end up having
pretty bad recall,

340
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,740
in that they don't end up
finding all of the patients.

341
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
And that's really why the
machine-learning-based

342
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,380
approaches end up
being very important

343
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,570
for this type of problem.

344
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,030
Now, this is just one example
of what I call a phenotype.

345
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,762
I call this a phenotype.

346
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,590
That's just what the
literature calls it.

347
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,900
It's a phenotype
for type 2 diabetes.

348
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,815
And the word, phenotype,
in this context

349
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,440
is exactly the same
thing as the label.

350
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,005
Yep.

351
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,280
AUDIENCE: What is abnormal mean?

352
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,340
PROFESSOR: For example, if the
HA1C result is 6.5 or higher,

353
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,230
you might say the
patient has diabetes.

354
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,840
AUDIENCE: OK, so this is a
lab result, not a medical--

355
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,263
PROFESSOR: Correct,
yeah, thanks.

356
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:15,930
Other questions.

357
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,370
AUDIENCE: What's the
phenotype, which part exactly

358
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,750
is the phenotype,
like, the whole thing?

359
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,440
PROFESSOR: The
whole thing, yeah.

360
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,300
So the construction,
where you say--

361
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,610
you follow this
decision tree, and you

362
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,460
get to a conclusion, which
is case, which means,

363
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,080
yes they're type 2 diabetic.

364
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,930
And if ever you don't reach this
point, then the answer is no,

365
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,060
they're not type 2 diabetic.

366
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,070
That's what I mean
by-- so that labeling

367
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,540
is what we're calling the
phenotype of type 2 diabetes.

368
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,645
Now later in the
semester, people

369
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,740
will use the word, phenotype,
to mean something else.

370
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,770
It's an overloaded term.

371
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,370
But this is what it's called
in this context as well.

372
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,850
Now here's an example
of a website--

373
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,130
it's from the PheKB project--

374
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,670
where you will
find tens to close

375
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,040
to 100 of these
phenotypes that have

376
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,310
been arduously created
for a whole range

377
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,500
of different conditions.

378
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,655
OK, so if you go
to this website,

379
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,530
and you click on any
one of these conditions,

380
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,380
like appendicitis,
autism, cataracts,

381
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,800
you'll see a different diagram
of this sort I just showed you.

382
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,920
So this is a real thing.

383
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,045
This is something that the
medical community really

384
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,220
needs to do in order to try
to derive the label that we

385
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,342
can then use in our
machine learning task.

386
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,910
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
is the lab value ground truth?

387
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,890
Like if somebody has
diabetes, then they must have

388
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,570
[INAUDIBLE].

389
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,288
It means they have been
diagnosed, and they must have--

390
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:36,850
PROFESSOR: Well,
so, for example,

391
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,670
you might have an
abnormal glucose

392
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,600
value for a variety of reasons.

393
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,530
One reason is because
you might have

394
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,270
what's called gestational
diabetes, which

395
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,360
is diabetes that's
induced due to pregnancy.

396
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,890
But those patients
typically-- well,

397
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,307
although it's a
predictive factor,

398
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:54,190
they don't always have
long-term type 2 diabetes.

399
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,780
So even the
laboratory test alone

400
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,056
doesn't tell the whole story.

401
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,386
AUDIENCE: You could be
diagnosed without having

402
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,720
abnormal diabetic?

403
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,510
PROFESSOR: That's
much less common here.

404
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,010
The story will
change in the future,

405
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,320
because there will be a
whole range of new diagnosis

406
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,750
techniques that might use
new modalities, like gene

407
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,220
expression, for example.

408
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,020
But typically, today, the
answer is yes to that.

409
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,520
Yep.

410
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,770
AUDIENCE: So if these
are made by doctors,

411
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,925
does that mean, for
every single disease,

412
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,405
there's one
definitive phenotype?

413
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,780
PROFESSOR: These
are usually made

414
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,730
by health outcomes
researchers, which usually

415
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,840
have clinicians on their team.

416
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,260
But the type of people who
often work on these often

417
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,650
come from the field of
epidemiology, for example.

418
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,150
And so what was
your question again?

419
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,692
AUDIENCE: Is there
just one phenotype

420
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:44,810
for every single disease?

421
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,185
PROFESSOR: Is
there one phenotype

422
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,690
for every different disease?

423
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,970
In the ideal world, you'd
have at least one phenotype

424
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,550
for every single disease
that could possibly exist.

425
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,630
Now, of course, you
might be interested

426
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,560
in different aspects.

427
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,352
Like you might be
interested in not knowing

428
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,920
just does the
patient have autism,

429
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,250
but where they are on
their autism spectrum.

430
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,360
You might not be
interested in knowing just,

431
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,813
do they have it
now, but you also

432
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,480
might want to know
when did they get it.

433
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,140
So there's a lot of subtleties
that could go into this.

434
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,750
But building these
up is really slow.

435
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,833
And validating them to
make sure that they're

436
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,250
going to work
across multiple data

437
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,750
sets is really challenging, and
usually is a negative result.

438
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,869
And so it's been a
very slow process

439
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,060
to do this manually,
which has led me

440
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,190
and many others to start
thinking about the machine

441
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,430
learning approaches for
how to do it automatically.

442
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,180
AUDIENCE: Just as a
follow-up, is there

443
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,120
any case where there's,
like, five autism phenotypes,

444
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,135
for example, or
multiple competing ones?

445
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:35,760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

446
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,090
So there are often many
different such rule-based

447
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,760
systems that give you
conflicting results.

448
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,047
Yes, that happens all the time.

449
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,630
AUDIENCE: Can these
rule-based systems

450
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,932
provide an estimate of when
their condition was onset?

451
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,390
PROFESSOR: Right,
so that's getting

452
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,973
at one of the subtleties I just
mentioned-- can these tell you

453
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,420
when the onset happened?

454
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,170
They're not typically
designed to do that,

455
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,660
but one can come up
with one to do it.

456
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,260
And so one way to
try to do that is

457
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,340
you change those rules to have
a time period associate to it.

458
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,710
And then you can imagine
applying those rules

459
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,450
in a sliding window
to the patient data

460
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,295
to see, when is the first
time that it triggers.

461
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,920
And that would be
one way to try to get

462
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,740
a sense of when onset was.

463
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,290
But there's a lot of
subtleties to that, too.

464
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,900
So I'm going to move on now.

465
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,400
I just want to give it some
sense of what that deriving

466
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,010
the labels ends up looking like.

467
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,090
Let's now turn to evaluation.

468
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,910
So a very commonly used
approach in this field

469
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,910
is to compute what's known as
the Receiver-Operator Curve,

470
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,873
or ROC curve.

471
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,540
And what this looks
at is the following.

472
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,300
First of all, this
is well-defined

473
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,900
for a binary
classification problem.

474
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,670
For a binary
classification problem

475
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,430
when you're using a
model that outputs,

476
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,310
let's say, a probability
or some continuous value,

477
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,932
then you could use that
continuous valid prediction.

478
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:58,390
If you wanted to
make a prediction,

479
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,450
you usually threshold it, right?

480
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,992
So you say, if it's greater than
0.5, it's a prediction of 1.

481
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:04,510
If it's less than 0.5,
prediction of zero.

482
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,645
But here we might be interested
in not just what minimizes,

483
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,970
let's say, 0-1 loss,
but you might also

484
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,910
be interested in
trading off, let's say,

485
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,130
false positives for
false negatives.

486
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,580
And so you might choose
different thresholds.

487
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,810
And you might want
to quantify how

488
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,730
do those trade-offs look
for different choices

489
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,740
of those thresholds of this
continuous value prediction.

490
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,620
And that's what the ROC
curve will show you.

491
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,260
So as you move along the
threshold, you can compute,

492
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,750
for every single threshold,
what is the true positive rate,

493
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,260
and what is the
false positive rate.

494
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,050
And that gives you a number.

495
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,550
And you try all
possible thresholds,

496
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,470
that gives you a curve.

497
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,190
And then you can compare curves
from different machine learning

498
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,250
algorithms.

499
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,890
For example, here,
I'm showing you,

500
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,610
in the green line, the
predictive model obtained

501
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,730
by using what we're calling the
traditional risk factors, so

502
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,940
something like eight
or 10 different risk

503
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,880
factors for type 2 diabetes
that are very commonly used

504
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,050
in the literature.

505
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,850
Versus in blue, it's
showing you what

506
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,630
you'd get if you just used
a naive L1-regularized

507
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,430
logistic regression model
with no domain knowledge,

508
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,660
just sort of throw in
the bag of features.

509
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,010
And you want to be up there.

510
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,530
You want to be in
that top left corner.

511
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,640
That's the goal here.

512
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,280
So you would like
that blue curve

513
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,360
to be up there, and then
all the way to the right.

514
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,940
Now, one way to try to
quantify in a single number

515
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,600
how useful any one
ROC curve is is

516
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,960
by looking at what's called
the area under the ROC curve.

517
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,870
And mathematically, this is
exactly what you'd expect.

518
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,340
This area is the area
under the ROC curve.

519
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,170
So you could just
integrate the curve,

520
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,383
and you get that number out.

521
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,800
Now, remember, I
told you you want

522
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
to be in the upper
left quadrant.

523
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,540
And so the goal
was to get an area

524
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,110
under the ROC curve of a 1.

525
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,600
Now, what would a random
prediction give you?

526
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,430
Any idea?

527
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:06,310
So if you're to just
flip a coin and guess--

528
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,060
what do you think?

529
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,660
AUDIENCE: 0.5.

530
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,940
PROFESSOR: 0.5?

531
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

532
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,043
PROFESSOR: Well, so I was a
little bit misleading when

533
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:16,210
I said you just flip a coin.

534
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:21,903
You got to flip a coin with
sort of different noise rates.

535
00:21:21,903 --> 00:21:23,320
And each one of
those will get you

536
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,970
sort of a different
place along this curve.

537
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,120
And if you look at
the curve that you

538
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,490
get from these
random guesses, it's

539
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,740
going to be the straight
line from 0 to 1.

540
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,040
And as you said, that will
then have an AUC of 0.5.

541
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,800
So 0.5 is going to
be random guessing.

542
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,538
1 is perfect.

543
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,830
And your algorithm is going
to be somewhere in between.

544
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,860

545
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,550
Now, of relevance to the
rest of today's lecture

546
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,890
is going to be an
alternative definition--

547
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,000
alternative way of computing
the area under the ROC curve.

548
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,340
So one way to compute it
is literally as I said.

549
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,860
You create that curve,
and you integrate

550
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,960
to get the area under it.

551
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,700
But one can show
mathematically--

552
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm not going to give
you the derivation here,

553
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,550
but you can look
it up on Wikipedia.

554
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,550
One can show mathematically
that an equivalent

555
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,670
way of computing the
area under the ROC curve

556
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,610
is to compute the probability
that an algorithm will

557
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,880
rank a positive-labeled
patient over a negative-labeled

558
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,510
patient.

559
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,300
So mathematically
what I'm talking about

560
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,760
is the following thing.

561
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,530
You're going to sum over
pairs of patients where--

562
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:38,470
I'm going to call x1 is a
patient with label y1 equals 1.

563
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,050
And x2 is a patient
with label y--

564
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,520
actually, I'll call it--

565
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,790
yeah, with label x2 equals 1.

566
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,305
So these are two
different patients.

567
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:53,360

568
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,320
I think I'm going to rewrite
it like this-- xi and xj,

569
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,960
just for generality's sake.

570
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,520
So we're going to sum this
up over all choices of i

571
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,580
and j such that yi and
yj have different labels.

572
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,973
So that should say yj equals 0.

573
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,390
And then you're
going to look at--

574
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,000
what you want to happen,
like suppose that you're

575
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,290
using a linear model here.

576
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,742
So your prediction is given
to you by, let's say, w.xj.

577
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:30,020

578
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,637
What you want is that this
should be smaller than w.xi.

579
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:37,850

580
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,140
So the j data point,
remember, was the one

581
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,990
that got the 0-th and
the i-th data point

582
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,430
is the one that got the 1 label.

583
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,460
So we want the score of the
data point that should've been 1

584
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,640
to be higher than the score
of the data point which

585
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,290
should've gotten the label 0.

586
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,540
And you just count up-- this
is an indicator function.

587
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,330
You just count up how many of
those were correctly ordered.

588
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,900
And then you're just going to
normalize by the total number

589
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,838
of comparisons that you do.

590
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:10,130
And it turns out that that
is exactly equal to the area

591
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,383
under the ROC curve.

592
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,550
And it really makes clear
that this is a notion that

593
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,320
really cares about ranking.

594
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,630
Are you getting the ranking
of patients correct?

595
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,880
Are you ranking
the ones who should

596
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,850
have been given 1 higher
than the ones that

597
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,490
should have gotten the label 0.

598
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,520
And importantly,
this whole measure

599
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,240
is actually invariant
to the label imbalance.

600
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,300
So you might have a very
imbalanced data set.

601
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,480
But if you were to
re-sample with now making

602
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,720
it a balanced data set, your
AUC of your predictive model

603
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,350
wouldn't change.

604
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,500
And that's a nice
property to have

605
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,760
when it comes to evaluating
settings where you might have

606
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,090
artificially created
a balanced data set

607
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,590
for computational concerns.

608
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,007
Even though the true setting
is imbalanced, there at least

609
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:01,715
you know that the
numbers are going to be

610
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:02,912
the same in both settings.

611
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,120
On the other hand, it also
has lots of disadvantages.

612
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,310
Because often you don't
care about the performance

613
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,350
of the whole entire curve.

614
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,780
Often you care about particular
parts along the curve.

615
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,130
So for example, in
last week's lecture,

616
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,358
I argued that really
what we often care about

617
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,900
is just the positive
predictive value

618
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,780
for a particular threshold.

619
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,430
And we want that to be as high
as possible for as few people

620
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,020
as possible.

621
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,315
Like, find the 100
most risky people,

622
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:29,690
and look at what
fraction of them

623
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,782
actually developed
type 2 diabetes.

624
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,740
And that setting, what
you're really looking at

625
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,580
is this part of the curve.

626
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,960
And so it turns out
there are generalizations

627
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,510
of area under the curve that
focus on parts of the curve.

628
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,930
And that goes by the
name of partial AUC.

629
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,330
For example, if you just
integrated from 0 to,

630
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,678
let's say, 0.1 of
the curve, then

631
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:53,220
you could still get a number to
compare two different curves,

632
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
but it's focusing on the area
of that curve that's actually

633
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,070
relevant for your
predictive purposes,

634
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,510
for your task at hand.

635
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,340
So that's all I want to
say about receiver-operator

636
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,330
characteristic curves.

637
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,900
Any questions?

638
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,400
Yep.

639
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,950
AUDIENCE: Could you talk more
about what the drawbacks were

640
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,277
of using this.

641
00:26:13,277 --> 00:26:15,610
Does the class imbalance--
is the class imbalance, then,

642
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,290
always a positive effect?

643
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:23,542
PROFESSOR: So the thing is, when
you want to use this approach,

644
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,500
depending on how you're
using the [INAUDIBLE],,

645
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,030
you might not be
able to tolerate

646
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,152
a 0.8 false positive rate.

647
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:32,610
So in some sense, what's going
on in this part of the curve

648
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,960
might be completely
irrelevant for your task.

649
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,202
And so one of the algorithms--
so one of these curves--

650
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,910
might look like it's
doing really, really

651
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,860
well over here, and
pretty poorly over here.

652
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,210
But if you're looking at the
full area under the ROC curve,

653
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,480
you won't notice that.

654
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,340
And so that's one
of the big problems.

655
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,890
Yeah.

656
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,725
AUDIENCE: And when would you
use this versus precision

657
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:56,280
recall or--

658
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so a
lot of the community

659
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,510
is interested in
precision recall curves.

660
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,463
And precision recall
curves, as opposed

661
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:04,380
to receiver-operator
curves, have the property

662
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,558
that they are not invariant
to class imbalance, which

663
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:10,350
in many settings is of
interest, because it

664
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,548
will allow you to capture
these types of quantities.

665
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,590
I'm not going to go into
depth about your reasons

666
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,465
for one or the other.

667
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,577
But that's something that
you could read up about,

668
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:19,410
and I encourage you to
post to Piazza about,

669
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,785
and we have
discussion on Piazza.

670
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:24,630

671
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:30,080
So the last evaluation quantity
that I want to talk about

672
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,450
is known as calibration.

673
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,238
And calibration, as
I've defined it here,

674
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,155
has to do with binary
classification problems.

675
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,690

676
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,258
Now, before you dig
into this figure, which

677
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,800
I'll explain in a
moment, let me just

678
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,140
give you the gist of what
I mean by calibration.

679
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,410
Suppose that your model
outputs a probability.

680
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,780
So you do logistic regression.

681
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,830
You get a probability out.

682
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:59,410
And your model says,
for these 10 patients,

683
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:08,890
that their likelihood of dying
in the next 48 hours is 0.7.

684
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,770
Suppose that's what
your model output.

685
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,360
If you were on the receiving
end of that result,

686
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,320
so you heard that,
0.7, what should you

687
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,938
expect about those 10 people?

688
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:22,480
What fraction of
them should actually

689
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,900
die in the next 48 hours?

690
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,300
Everyone could scream out loud.

691
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

692
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,720
PROFESSOR: So seven of them.

693
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,860
Seven of the 10 you would expect
to die in the next 48 hours

694
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,435
if the probability for all of
them that was output was 0.7.

695
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,343
All right, that's what
I mean by calibration.

696
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:42,760
So if, on the other
hand, what you

697
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,660
found was that only
one of them died,

698
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,730
then it would be a very weird
number that you're outputting.

699
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,307
And so the reason why this
notion of calibration,

700
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,640
which I'll define formally
in a second, is so important,

701
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,940
is when you're out
putting a probability,

702
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,190
and when you don't really
know how that probability is

703
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,640
going to be used.

704
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,180
If you knew-- if you had
some task loss in mind.

705
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,130
And you knew that
all that mattered

706
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,990
was the actual prediction, 1
or 0, then that would be fine.

707
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,802
But often predictions
in machine learning

708
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,260
are used in a much
more subtle way.

709
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,010
Like for example,
often your doctor

710
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,980
might have more information
than your computer has.

711
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,160
And so often they might
want to take the result

712
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,040
that your computer
predicts, and weigh

713
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,930
that against other evidence.

714
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,728
Or in some settings,
it's not just

715
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,020
weighting about other evidence.

716
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,300
Maybe it's also about
making a decision.

717
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,420
And that decision
might take exertion--

718
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,090
a utility, for example,
a patient preference

719
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:47,890
for suffering versus getting
a treatment that could

720
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,985
have big, adverse consequences.

721
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,360
And that's something
that Pete is

722
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,810
going to talk about much more
later in the semester, I think,

723
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,060
how to formalize that notion.

724
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,360
But at this point, I just want
to sort of get out the point

725
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,610
that the probabilities
themselves could be important.

726
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,535
And having the
probabilities be meaningful

727
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,160
is something that
one can now quantify.

728
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,940
So how do we quantify it?

729
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,470
Well, one way to
try to quantify it

730
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,105
is to create the
following prompt.

731
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:22,970
Actually, we'll
call it a histogram.

732
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,960
So on the x-axis is the
predicted probability.

733
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,650

734
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,500
So that's what I meant by p-hat.

735
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,920
On the y-axis is the
true probability.

736
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,740
It's what I mean when I say
the fraction of individuals

737
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,140
with that predicted
probability that actually

738
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,120
got the positive outcome.

739
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,510
That's going to be the y-axis.

740
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,911
So I'll call that
the true probability.

741
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:57,630

742
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,110
And what we would like
to see is that this

743
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,210
is a line, a straight line,
meaning these two should always

744
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,480
be equal.

745
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,840
And in the example
I gave, remember

746
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,030
I said that there
were a bunch of people

747
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,190
with 0.7 probability
predicted, but for whom

748
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,628
only one out of them actually
got the positive end.

749
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:23,670
So that would have been
something like over here.

750
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,550

751
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,460
Whereas you would have
expected it to be over there.

752
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,210
So you might ask, how
do I create such a plot

753
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,800
from finite data?

754
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,530
Well, a common way to do
so is to bin your data.

755
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,440
So you'll create intervals.

756
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,290
So this bin is the
bin from 0 to 0.1.

757
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:52,620
This bin is the bin from
0.1 to 0.2, and so on.

758
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,160
And then you'll look to see,
OK, how many people for whom

759
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,510
the predicted probability
was between 0 and 0.1

760
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,770
actually died?

761
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,698
And you'll get a number out.

762
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:05,490
And now here's where
I can go to this plot.

763
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,198
That's exactly what
I'm showing you here.

764
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,330
So for now, ignore the
bar charts and the bottom,

765
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,930
and just look at the line.

766
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,073
So let's focus on
just the green line.

767
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,990
Here I'm showing you
several different models.

768
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,580
For now, just focus
on the green line.

769
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,170
So the green line, by the way,
notice it looks pretty good.

770
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,560
It's almost a straight line.

771
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
So how did I compute it?

772
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,510
Well, first of all,
notice the number of ticks

773
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,510
are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

774
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,810
OK, so there are 10
points along this line.

775
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,330
And each of those corresponds
to one of these bins.

776
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,810
So the first point
is the 0 to 0.1 bin.

777
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,930
The second point is the
0.1 to 0.2 bin, and so on.

778
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,372
So that's how it computed this.

779
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:46,830
The next thing you
notice is that I

780
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,710
have confidence intervals.

781
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,500
And the reason I compute
these confidence intervals

782
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,020
is because sometimes
you just might not

783
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,060
have that much data
in one of these bins.

784
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,880
So for example, suppose
your algorithm almost never

785
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,560
said that someone has a
predictive probability of 0.99.

786
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,452
Then until you
get a ton of data,

787
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,910
you're not going to know what
fraction of those individuals

788
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,120
actually went on to
develop the event.

789
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,610
And you should be looking
at sort of the confidence

790
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,940
interval of this line,
which should take that

791
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,310
into consideration.

792
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,720
And a different way to try to
understand that notion, now

793
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,830
looking at the
numbers, is what I'm

794
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,663
showing you in the bar
charts in the bottom.

795
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:27,790
On the bar charts,
I'm showing you

796
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,510
the number of individuals or
the fraction of individuals

797
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,550
who actually got that
predicted probability.

798
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,210
So now let's start
comparing the lines.

799
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,600
So the blue line shown
here is a machine

800
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,262
learning algorithm which
is predicting infection

801
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,220
in the emergency rooms.

802
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,512
It's a slightly different
problem than the diabetes one

803
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:50,520
we looked at earlier.

804
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,960
And it's using a bag of words
model from clinical text.

805
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,020
The red line is using
just chief complaint.

806
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,567
So it's using one piece
of structured data

807
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,400
that you get at one
point of time in the ER.

808
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,960
So it's using very
little information.

809
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,199
And you can see that both models
are somewhat well calibrated.

810
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,800
But the intervals--
the confidence

811
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,679
intervals of both the
red and the purple lines

812
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,389
gets really big towards the end.

813
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,969
And if you look at
these bar charts,

814
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,760
it explains why,
because the models

815
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,190
that use less information end
up being much more risk-averse.

816
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,010
So they will never predict
a very high probability.

817
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,502
They will always sort of
stay in this lower regime.

818
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:42,960
And that's why we have very
big confidence intervals there.

819
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,340

820
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,159
OK, so that's all I want
to say about evaluation.

821
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,020
And I won't take any
questions on this right

822
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,395
now, because I
really want to get

823
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:55,560
on to the rest of the lecture.

824
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,852
But again, if you have any
questions, post to Piazza,

825
00:34:57,852 --> 00:34:59,810
and I'm happy to discuss
them with you offline.

826
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,210

827
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,990
So, in summary, we've
talked about how

828
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,610
to reduce risk stratification
to binary classification.

829
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,470
I've told you how to
derive the labels.

830
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,880
I've given you one example
of machine learning algorithm

831
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,440
you can use, and I talked to
you about how to evaluate it.

832
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,890
What could possibly go wrong?

833
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,570

834
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,335
So let's look at some examples.

835
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,960
And these are a small number of
examples of what could possibly

836
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,780
go wrong.

837
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,680
There are many more.

838
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,340
So here's some data.

839
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,950
I'm showing you--
for the same problem

840
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,260
we looked at before,
diabetes onset, I'm

841
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:44,050
showing you the prevalence of
type 2 diabetes as recorded by,

842
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,926
let's say, diagnosis
codes across time.

843
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:49,450
All right, so over here is 1980.

844
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,290
Over here is 2012.

845
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,340
Look at that.

846
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,088
It is not a flat line.

847
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:57,130
Now, what does that mean?

848
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,720
Does that mean that the
population is eating much more

849
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,810
unhealthy from 1980 to
2012, and so more people

850
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,890
are becoming diabetic?

851
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,230
That would be one
plausible answer.

852
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:17,660
Another plausible explanation
is that something has changed.

853
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,670
So in fact I'm showing you
with these blue lines, well,

854
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,240
in fact, there was a change
in the diagnostic criteria

855
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,790
for diabetes.

856
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,740
And so now the patient
population actually

857
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,390
didn't change much
between, let's say,

858
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,130
this time point at
that time point.

859
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,390
But what really led
it to this big uptick,

860
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,300
according to one theory, is
because the diagnostic criteria

861
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,460
changed.

862
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,240
So who we're calling
diabetic has changed.

863
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,460
Because diseases are,
at the end of the day,

864
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,760
a human-made concept, you know,
what do we call some disease.

865
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,747
And so the data is
changing, as you see here.

866
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,080
Let me show you another example.

867
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,070
Oh, by the way, so the
consequence of that is that

868
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,720
automatically-derived labels--

869
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,125
for example, if you use
one of those phenotyping

870
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,960
algorithms I showed you
earlier, the rules--

871
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,770

872
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,680
what the label is
derived for over here

873
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,960
might be very different
from the label that's

874
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,460
derived from over
here, particularly

875
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,880
if it's using data such
as diagnosis codes that

876
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,947
have changed in
meaning over the years.

877
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,030
So that's one consequence.

878
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,762
There'll be other consequences
I'll tell you about later.

879
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:25,720
Here's another example.

880
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,012
And by the way, this notion
is called non-stationarity,

881
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,080
that the data is
changing across time.

882
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,170
It's not stationary.

883
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,650
Here's another example.

884
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,490
On the x-axis again
I'm showing you time.

885
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:44,800
Here each column is a
month, from 2005 to 2014.

886
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,930
And on the y-axis, for every
sort of row of this table,

887
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,625
I'm showing you a
laboratory test.

888
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,023

889
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:56,440
And here we're not looking at
the results of the lab test,

890
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,080
we're only looking
at what fraction

891
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,110
of-- at how many lab
tests of that type

892
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,426
were performed at
this point in time.

893
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:10,510
And now you might expect
that, broadly speaking,

894
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,150
the number of glucose tests,
the number of white blood cell

895
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:21,040
count tests, the number of
neutrophil tests and so on

896
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,860
might be pretty constant
across time, on average,

897
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,200
because you're averaging
over lots of people.

898
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,090
But indeed what you see
here is that, in fact,

899
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,210
there is a huge amount
of non-stationarity.

900
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,360
Which tests are
ordered dramatically

901
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,230
changes across time.

902
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,310
So for example you see
this one line over here,

903
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,240
where it's all blue, meaning
no one is ordering the test,

904
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,360
until this point in time,
when people start using it.

905
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,550
What could that be?

906
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,970
Any ideas?

907
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,818
Yeah.

908
00:38:50,818 --> 00:38:54,067
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

909
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,650
PROFESSOR: So the test was used
less, or really, in this case,

910
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,320
not used at all.

911
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,330
And then suddenly it was used.

912
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,320
Why might that happen?

913
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,940
In the back.

914
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,690
AUDIENCE: A new test.

915
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,090
PROFESSOR: A new test, right,
because technology changes.

916
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,660
Suddenly we come up with a
new diagnostic test, a new lab

917
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,770
test.

918
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,177
And we can start using it,
where it didn't exist before.

919
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:13,010
So obviously there was
no data on it before.

920
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,014
What's another reason why it
might have suddenly showed up?

921
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:17,926
Yep.

922
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:21,406
AUDIENCE: It could be like
annual check-ups become

923
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:26,510
mandatory, or that it's part of
the test admission at hospital.

924
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,800
Like, it's an additional test.

925
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,020
PROFESSOR: I'll stick
with your first example.

926
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,420
Maybe that test
becomes mandatory.

927
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,880
OK, so maybe there's
a clinical guideline

928
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,490
that is created at this
point in time, right there.

929
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,490
And health insurers
decide we're going

930
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,647
to reimburse for this test
at this point in time.

931
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:49,480
And the test might've
been really expensive.

932
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,670
So no one would have
done it beforehand.

933
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,830
And now that the health
insurance companies

934
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,480
are going to pay for it,
now people start doing it.

935
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,190
So it might have
existed beforehand.

936
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,790
But if no one would pay for
it, no one would use it.

937
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,460
What's another reason why you
might see something like this,

938
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,762
or maybe even a gap like this?

939
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,220
Notice, here in
the middle, there's

940
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,387
this huge gap in the middle.

941
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:07,770
What might have explained that?

942
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:16,195

943
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:17,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

944
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,862
PROFESSOR: Hold on.

945
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:19,865
Yep, over here.

946
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,490
AUDIENCE: Maybe your
patient population

947
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,206
is mostly of a certain age,
and coverage for something

948
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:28,870
changes once your age
crosses a threshold.

949
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,540
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
one explanation--

950
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,610
I think it's not plausible
in this data set,

951
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,410
but it is plausible
for some data sets--

952
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:40,380
is that maybe your
patients at time 0

953
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,860
were all of exactly
the same age.

954
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,610
So maybe there's some
amount of alignment.

955
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,740
And suddenly, at this
point in time, let's say,

956
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,492
women only get, let's say,
their annual mammography

957
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,700
once they turn a certain age.

958
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,420
And so that might be one reason
why you would see nothing

959
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,720
until one point in time.

960
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
And maybe that would
change across time as well.

961
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,838
Maybe they'll stop getting it
at some point after menopause.

962
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,130
That's not true, but let's say.

963
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,527

964
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:08,610
So that's one explanation.

965
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,110
In this case, it
doesn't make sense,

966
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,518
because the patient
population is very mixed.

967
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:15,060
So you could think about it as
being roughly at steady state.

968
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,060
So they're not-- you'll have
patients of all ages here.

969
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,280
What's another reason?

970
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,990
Someone raised their
hand over here.

971
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,520
Yep.

972
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
just going to say,

973
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,610
maybe the EMR shut
down for awhile,

974
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,660
and so they were only
doing stuff on paper,

975
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,710
and they only were able
to record 4 things.

976
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,210
PROFESSOR: Ding
ding ding ding ding.

977
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,340
Yes, that's right.

978
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,740
So maybe the EMR shut down.

979
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,100
Or in this case,
we had data issues.

980
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,830
So this data was
acquired somehow.

981
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,930
For example, maybe
it was required

982
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,460
through a contract
with something

983
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,460
like Webquest or LabCorp.

984
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,510
And maybe, during that
four-month interval,

985
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,202
there was contract negotiation.

986
00:41:56,202 --> 00:41:57,660
And so suddenly we
couldn't get the

987
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,100
Data for that time period.

988
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,470
Or maybe our databases
crashed, and we suddenly

989
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,480
lost all the data
for that time period.

990
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,567
This happens, and this
happens all the time,

991
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,150
and not just the
health care industry,

992
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,060
but other industries as well.

993
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,210
And as a result of those
systemic-type changes,

994
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,170
your data is also going to be
non-stationary across time.

995
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,420
So now we've seen three or
four different explanations

996
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,540
for why this happens.

997
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,720
And the reality is really
a mixture of all of these.

998
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,037
And just as in the previous--

999
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:27,120
so in the previous example,
notice how what really

1000
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,010
changed here is that
the derived labels might

1001
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,830
change meaning across time.

1002
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,930
Now the significance
of the features

1003
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,690
used in the machine
learning models

1004
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,048
would really change across time.

1005
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,840
And that's one of the
consequences of this,

1006
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,090
particular if you're driving
features from lab test values.

1007
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,790
Here's one last example.

1008
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,430
Again, on the x-axis
here, I have time.

1009
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,460
On the y-axis here, I'm
showing the number of times

1010
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,780
that you observed some
diagnosis code of some kind.

1011
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,530
This cyan line is ICD-9 codes.

1012
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,090
And this red line
are ICD-10 codes.

1013
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,590
You might remember that Pete
mentioned in an earlier lecture

1014
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,340
that there was a big shift from
ICD-9 coding to ICD-10 coding

1015
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,048
at some point.

1016
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:12,840
When was that time?

1017
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,212
It was precisely this time.

1018
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:17,670
And so if you think about the
feature vector that you would

1019
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,010
derive for your machine
learning problem,

1020
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,740
you would have one feature
for all ICD-9 codes, and one--

1021
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,190
a whole set of features
for all ICD-10 codes.

1022
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,930
And those ICD-9-based
features are

1023
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,120
going to be-- they're going
to be used quite a bit

1024
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,000
in this time period.

1025
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And then suddenly they're
going to be completely

1026
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,690
sparse in this time period.

1027
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,740
And ICD-10 features
start to become used.

1028
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,990
And you could imagine that
if you did machine learning

1029
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,340
using just ICD-9
data, and then you

1030
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,173
tried to apply your model
at this point in time,

1031
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:49,590
it's going to do horribly,
because it's expecting features

1032
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,780
that it no longer has access to.

1033
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,358
And this happens all the time.

1034
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:54,900
And in fact, what
I'm describing here

1035
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,020
is actually a major problem for
the whole health care industry.

1036
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,407
For the next five
years, everyone

1037
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:00,990
is going to grapple
with this problem,

1038
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,240
because they want to use their
historical data for machine

1039
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,698
learning, but their
historical data

1040
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:08,270
is very different from
their recent data.

1041
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,390
So now, in the face of all of
this non-stationarity that I

1042
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,560
just described, did we do
anything wrong in the diabetes

1043
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,030
risk stratification problem
that I told you about earlier?

1044
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,530
Thoughts.

1045
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,050

1046
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,300
That was my paper, by the way.

1047
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,000
Did I make an error?

1048
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,500
Thoughts.

1049
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:36,990

1050
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,850
Don't be afraid.

1051
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm often wrong.

1052
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,960

1053
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,710
I'm just asking
specifically about the way

1054
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,835
I evaluated the models.

1055
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:51,200

1056
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,700
Yep.

1057
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,551
AUDIENCE: This wasn't
an error, but one thing,

1058
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:56,920
like if I was a doctor
I would like to see

1059
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,054
is the sensitivity to--

1060
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:01,434
like, the inclusion
criteria if I

1061
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:04,710
remove the HBA1C for instance.

1062
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,456
Like most people, they have
compared to having either Rx

1063
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,970
or [INAUDIBLE] then
kind of evaluating the--

1064
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,720
PROFESSOR: So understanding
the robustness

1065
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,730
to changing the data a
bit is something that

1066
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,350
would be of a lot of interest.

1067
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,460
I agree.

1068
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,960
But that's not
immediately suggested

1069
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,720
by the non-stationarity results.

1070
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,330
Not something that's suggested
by non-stationarity results.

1071
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,830
Our TA in the front
row has an idea.

1072
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,830
Yeah, let's hear it.

1073
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,625
AUDIENCE: The train
and test distributions

1074
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,250
were drawn from the
same-- or the train

1075
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,503
and tests were drawn from
the same distribution.

1076
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:35,920
PROFESSOR: So in the way that
we did our evaluation there,

1077
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,760
we said, OK, we're going to set
it up such that on January 1,

1078
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,710
2009, we're predicting
what's going to happen

1079
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,350
in the following three years.

1080
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,140
And we segmented our
patient population

1081
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,800
into train, validate, and
test, but at all times,

1082
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,040
using that same setup, January
1 2009, as the prediction time.

1083
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,570
Now, we learned this
model, and it's now 2018.

1084
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,000
We want to apply
this model today.

1085
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,430
And I computed an area
under the ROC curve.

1086
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,650
I computed positive
predictive values

1087
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:13,690
using that retrospective data.

1088
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,650
And I handed those
off to my partners.

1089
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,530
And they might hope that those
numbers are reflective of what

1090
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,390
their models would do today.

1091
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,090
But because of these issues
I just told you about--

1092
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,940
for example, that
the number of people

1093
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,232
who have type 2 diabetes,
and even the definition of it

1094
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:31,480
has changed.

1095
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,550
Because of the fact that
the laboratory-- ignore

1096
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:34,180
this part over here.

1097
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,013
That's just a fluke.

1098
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:36,940
But the fact, because
of the laboratory

1099
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,860
tests that were
available during training

1100
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,940
might be different from the
ones that are available now,

1101
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,850
and because of the fact that
we have only ICD-10 data now,

1102
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,172
and not ICD-9, for
all of those reasons,

1103
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,630
our predictive
performance is going

1104
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,870
to be really horrible
now, Particularly

1105
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,663
because of this last issue
of not having ICD-9s.

1106
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:57,580
Our predictive model is
going to work horribly

1107
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:02,170
now if it was trained on
data from 2008 or 2009.

1108
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,020
And so we would have
never ever even recognized

1109
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,840
that if we used the validation
set up that we had done there.

1110
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,107
So I wrote that paper when
I was young and naive.

1111
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:13,480
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING]

1112
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,540
I'm a little bit
more gray-haired now.

1113
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,640
And so in our more recent
work-- for example,

1114
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,510
this is a paper which
we're working on right now,

1115
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,670
done by a master's student
of mine, Helen Zhou,

1116
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,160
and is looking at predicting
antibiotic resistance,

1117
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,950
now we're a little bit smarter
about over evaluation setup.

1118
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,357
And we decided to set it up
a little bit differently.

1119
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:33,940
So what I'm showing
you now is the way

1120
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,650
that we chose,
trained, validated

1121
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,960
and test for our population.

1122
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,240
So we segmented our data.

1123
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:47,230
So the x-axis here is time,
and the y-axis here are people.

1124
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,732
So you can think of each person
as being a different row.

1125
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,940
And you can imagine that we
randomly sorted the rows.

1126
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,490

1127
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:59,150
What we did is we segmented our
data into these four quadrants.

1128
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,980
The first two quadrants, we
used for train and validate.

1129
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,910
Notice, by the way, that
we have different people

1130
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,498
in the training set as we
do in the validate set.

1131
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,290
That's important for
another quantity which

1132
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,010
I'll talk about in a minute.

1133
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,040
So we used this data
for train and validate.

1134
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,870
And that's, again,
very similar to the way

1135
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,030
we did it in the diabetes paper.

1136
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,356
But now, for testing,
we use this future data.

1137
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:29,287
So we used data
from 2014 to 2016.

1138
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,120
And one can imagine two
different quadrants.

1139
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,710
You might be
interested in knowing,

1140
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,260
for the same patients for
whom you made predictions

1141
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,030
on during training, how
would your predictions do

1142
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,743
for those same people at
test time in the future data.

1143
00:48:44,743 --> 00:48:46,660
And that's assuming that
what we're predicting

1144
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,670
is something that's much
more myopic in nature.

1145
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,830
In this case it was
predicting, are they

1146
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,973
going to be resistant
to some antibiotic?

1147
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:55,390
But you can also look at it
for a completely different set

1148
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,190
of patients, for
patients who are not

1149
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,660
used during training at all.

1150
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,680
And suppose that this 2
bucket isn't used at all,

1151
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,630
for those patients,
how do we do, again,

1152
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,063
using the future data for that.

1153
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:07,480
And the advantage
of this setup is

1154
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,900
that it can really help you
assess non-stationarity.

1155
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,050
So if your model
really took advantage

1156
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,860
of features that were
available in 2007, 2008, 2009,

1157
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,422
but weren't available
in 2014, you

1158
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,130
would see a big drop
in your performance.

1159
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,547
Looking at the
drop in performance

1160
00:49:22,547 --> 00:49:24,550
from your validate set
in this time period,

1161
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,740
to your test set from
that time period,

1162
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,650
that drop in performance
will be uniquely attributed

1163
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,760
to the non-stationarity.

1164
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,190
So it's a good way
to diagnose it.

1165
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,690
Yep.

1166
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,065
AUDIENCE: Just
some clarification

1167
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:38,013
on non-stationarity-- is it the
fact that certain data is just

1168
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:39,430
lost altogether,
or is it the fact

1169
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,240
that it's just
encoded differently,

1170
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,698
and so then it's difficult
to get that mapping correct?

1171
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:44,365
PROFESSOR: Both.

1172
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:45,790
Both of these happen.

1173
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,980
So I have a big
research program now

1174
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,115
which is asking not just how--

1175
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,990
so this is how you can
evaluate and recognize

1176
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,510
there's a problem.

1177
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,052
But of course there's a really
interesting research question,

1178
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:57,450
which is, how can you make
use of the non-stationarity.

1179
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,870
Right, so for example,
you had ICD-9/ICD-10 data.

1180
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,020
You don't want to just
throw away the ICD-9 data.

1181
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,640
Is there a way to use it?

1182
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,510
So the naive answer, which is
what the community is largely

1183
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,990
using today, is come
up with a mapping.

1184
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,700
Come up with a manual
mapping from ICD-9 to ICD-10

1185
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,870
so that you can sort of
manually transform your data

1186
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,820
into this new format
such that the models you

1187
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,300
learn from this older time
is useful in the future time.

1188
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,520
That's the boring
and simple answer.

1189
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,020
But I think we could
do much better.

1190
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,437
For example, we can learn new
representations of the data.

1191
00:50:31,437 --> 00:50:33,780
We can learn that
mapping directly

1192
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,290
in order to optimize
for your sort of most

1193
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,082
recent performance.

1194
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,582
And there's a whole bunch more
that we can talk about later.

1195
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:41,422
Yep.

1196
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:44,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
non-stationary change,

1197
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,970
this will [INAUDIBLE]
does not ensure robustness

1198
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:50,820
to the future.

1199
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,970
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1200
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,360
So this allows you to detect
that a non-stationarity has

1201
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,800
happened.

1202
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,950
And it allows you to say
that your model is going

1203
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,202
to generalize to 2014-2016.

1204
00:51:00,202 --> 00:51:02,535
But of course, that doesn't
mean that your model's going

1205
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:06,397
to generalize to 2016-2018.

1206
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,480
And so how do you do that?

1207
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,310
How do you have
confidence in that?

1208
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,477
Well, that's a really
interesting research question.

1209
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,610
We don't have good
answers to that today.

1210
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:19,020
From a practical perspective,
the best I can offer you today

1211
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,590
is, build in these checks
and balances all the time.

1212
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,380
So continuously sort
of evaluate how you're

1213
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,780
doing on the most recent data.

1214
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,150
And if you see big
changes, throw a red flag.

1215
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,510
Build more checks and balances
into your deployment process.

1216
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,790
If you see a bunch of
patients who are getting

1217
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,610
predicted probabilities
of 1, and in the past,

1218
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,110
you'd never predicted
probability 1,

1219
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,003
that might tell you something.

1220
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:44,670
Then much later in the semester,
we'll talk about robust machine

1221
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,690
learning approaches,
for example,

1222
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,357
approaches that have
been designed to be

1223
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,290
robust against adversaries.

1224
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,930
And those type of
approaches as well

1225
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,370
will allow you to be much more
robust to particular types

1226
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,410
of data set shift, of
which non-stationarity

1227
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,400
is one example.

1228
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
But it's a big,
open research field.

1229
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,900
Yep.

1230
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,610
AUDIENCE: So just to make sure I
have the understanding correct,

1231
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,360
theoretically, if you
could map everything

1232
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,500
from the old data set to the new
data set, like the encodings,

1233
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,456
would it still be
OK, like the results

1234
00:52:09,456 --> 00:52:12,165
you get on the future data set?

1235
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,040
PROFESSOR: If you could
do a perfect mapping,

1236
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,457
and it's one to one, and the
distributions of those things

1237
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:18,750
also didn't change, then yeah.

1238
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,660
Really what you need to assess
is, is there data set shift?

1239
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,970
Is your training
distribution, after mapping,

1240
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,147
the same as your
testing distribution?

1241
00:52:26,147 --> 00:52:27,730
If the answer is
yes, you're all good.

1242
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,110
If you're not,
you're in trouble.

1243
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:29,610
Yep.

1244
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,068
AUDIENCE: What seems to be the
test set of traits set here?

1245
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:35,010
Or what [INAUDIBLE]?

1246
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,530
PROFESSOR: So 1 is using
data only from 2007-2013,

1247
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,950
3 is using data
only from 2014-2016.

1248
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,611
AUDIENCE: But in the case,
like, the output we care about

1249
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:47,016
happened in, like,
2007-2013, then

1250
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:49,580
that observation would be
not-- it wouldn't be useful.

1251
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so for
the diabetes problem,

1252
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,090
there's also just
inclusion/exclusion criteria

1253
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,310
that you have to deal with.

1254
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,727
For what I'm showing you here,
I'm talking about a setting

1255
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,840
where you might be making
multiple predictions

1256
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,230
for patients across time.

1257
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,338
So it's a much more
myopic prediction task.

1258
00:53:04,338 --> 00:53:05,880
But one could come
up with an analogy

1259
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,720
to this for the
diabetes setting.

1260
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:15,000
Like, for example, just hold out
half of the patients at random.

1261
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,290
And then for your training
set, use data up to 2009,

1262
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,760
and evaluate on data
only up to 2013.

1263
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,610
And for your test set, pretend
as if it was January 1, 2013,

1264
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:35,390
and look at
performance up to 2017.

1265
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:36,600
And so that would be--

1266
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,510
you're changing your prediction
time to use more recent data.

1267
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,330

1268
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,727
So the next subtlety is--

1269
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:49,060
it's a name that I put on to it.

1270
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,220
This isn't a standard name.

1271
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,200
This is what I'm calling
intervention-tainted outcomes.

1272
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,130

1273
00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:01,210
And so the example here came
from your reading for today.

1274
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,772
The reading was this paper
on intelligible models

1275
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:05,980
for health care predicting
pneumonia risk in hospital

1276
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,350
30-day admissions from KDD 2015.

1277
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,040
So in that paper,
they give an example--

1278
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,070
it's a very old example--

1279
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,840
of trying to use
a predictive model

1280
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,920
to understand a patient's
risk of mortality

1281
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,100
when they come
into the hospital.

1282
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,010
And what they learned-- and
they used a rule-based learning

1283
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,510
algorithm-- and
what they discovered

1284
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,740
was a rule that said if
the patient has asthma,

1285
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,445
then they have
low risk of dying.

1286
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:35,320
So these are all patients
who have pneumonia.

1287
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,140
So a patient who comes in
with pneumonia and asthma

1288
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,270
has a lower risk of
dying than a patient who

1289
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:45,400
comes in with pneumonia and does
not have a history of asthma.

1290
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,830
OK, that's what this rule says.

1291
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,550
And this paper argued
that there's something

1292
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:54,440
wrong with that learned model.

1293
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,110
Any of you remember
what that was?

1294
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,390
Someone who hasn't
talked today, please.

1295
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,250
Yeah, in the back.

1296
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,875
AUDIENCE: It was that
those with asthma

1297
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:02,204
had more aggressive treatment.

1298
00:55:02,204 --> 00:55:04,930
So that means that they had
a higher chance of survival.

1299
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,540
PROFESSOR: Patients with asthma
had more aggressive treatment.

1300
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,998
In particular, they
might have been

1301
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:10,600
admitted to the
intensive care unit

1302
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,080
for more careful vigilance.

1303
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,830
And as a result, they
had better outcomes.

1304
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,080
Yes, that's exactly right.

1305
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,370
So the real story behind this
is that risk stratification,

1306
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,140
as we talked about
the last couple weeks,

1307
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,180
it's used to drive
interventions.

1308
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,360
And those interventions, if
they happened in the past data,

1309
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,350
would change the outcomes.

1310
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,550
So in this case,
you might imagine

1311
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,530
using the learned
predictive model to say,

1312
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,218
a new patient comes in,
this new patient has asthma,

1313
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:40,010
and so we're going to
say they're low risk.

1314
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,340
And if we took a naive action
based on that prediction,

1315
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,800
we might say, OK,
let's send them home.

1316
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,742
They're at low risk of dying.

1317
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:48,700
But if we did that, we
could be killing people.

1318
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,710
Because the reason
why they were low

1319
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,950
risk is because they had those
interventions in the past.

1320
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,650

1321
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,800
So here's what's going
on in that picture.

1322
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,028
You have your
data, X. And you're

1323
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,570
trying to make a prediction at
some point in time, let's say,

1324
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,070
emergency department triage.

1325
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,630
You want to predict
some outcome Y,

1326
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,480
let's say, whether the patient
dies at some defined point

1327
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,710
in the future.

1328
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:16,960
Now, the challenge is that, as
stated in the machine learning

1329
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,940
tasks that you saw there,
all you had access to

1330
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:25,420
was X and Y, the covariance of
the features and the outcome.

1331
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,150
And so you're
predicting Y from X,

1332
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,670
but you're marginalizing
over everything

1333
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,490
that happens in between, in
this case, the treatment.

1334
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,777
So the good outcomes,
people surviving,

1335
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:38,860
might have been due to
what's going on in between.

1336
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,402
But what's going on
in between is not

1337
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:43,780
even observed in the
data necessarily.

1338
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,202
So how do we address
this problem?

1339
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,160
Well, the first thing I
want you to think about

1340
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,030
is, can we even recognize
that this is a problem?

1341
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,260
And that's where
that article really

1342
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,630
suggests that using an
unintelligible model, a model

1343
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,510
that you can introspect and
try to understand a little bit,

1344
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,270
is actually really important
for even recognizing

1345
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,400
that weird things are happening.

1346
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,860
And this is a
topic which we will

1347
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,570
talk about in a lecture towards
the end of the semester in much

1348
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,070
more--

1349
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,200
Jack will talk about
algorithms for interpreting

1350
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,247
machine learning models.

1351
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:14,080
So that's important.

1352
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,090
You've got to recognize
what's going on.

1353
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,780
But what do you do about it?

1354
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,820
So here are some hacks.

1355
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,390
Hack number 1--
modify the model.

1356
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,120
This is the solution that is
proposed in the paper you read.

1357
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,740
They said, OK, if it's a
simple rule-based prediction

1358
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,360
that the learning
algorithm outputs to you,

1359
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,180
you could see the rule
that doesn't make sense,

1360
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,800
you could use your
clinical insight

1361
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,850
to recognize it
doesn't make sense.

1362
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,933
You might even be able to
explain why it happened.

1363
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:41,780
And then you just
remove that rule.

1364
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:47,570
So you manually modify the model
to push it towards something

1365
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,883
that's more sensible.

1366
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,550
All right, so that's
what was suggested.

1367
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,020
And I think it's nonsense.

1368
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,060
I don't think that's ever
going to work in today's world.

1369
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,940
In today's world of
high-dimensional models,

1370
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,915
there's always going to be
surrogates which are somehow

1371
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:03,290
picked up by a
learning algorithm

1372
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,510
that you will not
even recognize.

1373
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,910
And it will be really hard
to modify it in the way

1374
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,040
that you want.

1375
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,540
Maybe it's impossible using the
simple approach, by the way.

1376
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,920
Another interesting
research question--

1377
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,480
how do you actually
make this work

1378
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,218
in a high-dimensional setting?

1379
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:18,260
But for now, let's say we
don't know how to do it

1380
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,080
in a high-dimensional setting.

1381
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,480
So what are your other choices?

1382
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,080
Hack number 2 is to redefine
the outcome altogether,

1383
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,180
to change what
you're predicting.

1384
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,570
So for example, if you
go back to this picture,

1385
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,490
and instead of
trying to predict Y,

1386
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,490
death, if you could try to find
some surrogate for the thing

1387
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,410
you care about, which
is pre-treatment,

1388
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,160
and you predict
that thing instead,

1389
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,070
then you'll be back in business.

1390
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,215
And so, for example, in one
of the optional readings for--

1391
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:49,310
or actually I think in the
second required reading

1392
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,380
for today's class,
it was a paper

1393
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,990
about risk revocation
for sepsis, which

1394
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,850
is often caused by infection.

1395
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,640
And what they show
in that article

1396
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,850
is that there are laboratory
test results, such as lactate,

1397
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:03,980
and there are others,
which can give you

1398
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,500
a hint that this patient
might be on a path

1399
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,960
to clinical deterioration.

1400
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,590
And that test might precede
the interventions to try

1401
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,140
to take care of that condition.

1402
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,720
And so if you instead
change your outcome

1403
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,230
to be predicting that
surrogate, then you're

1404
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:26,470
getting around this problem
that I just pointed out.

1405
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:31,450
Now, a third hack is from
one of the optional readings

1406
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,170
from today's lecture,
this paper by Suchi

1407
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,380
Saria and her students, from
Science Translational Medicine

1408
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,080
2015.

1409
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,455
It's a really
well-written paper.

1410
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:38,960
I highly recommend reading it.

1411
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,370
In that paper, they suggest
formalizing the problem

1412
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,990
as one of censoring,
which is what

1413
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,365
we'll be talking about for
the very last third of today's

1414
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:47,110
lecture.

1415
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,830
In particular, what
they say is suppose

1416
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:53,210
you see that a patient is
treated for the condition.

1417
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:56,620
Let's say they're
treated for sepsis.

1418
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,810
Then if the patient is
treated for that condition,

1419
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,390
then we don't know what would
have happened to them had they

1420
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:02,570
not been treated.

1421
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:07,990
So we don't observe the outcome,
death given no treatment.

1422
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,070
And so we're going to treat
it as an unknown outcome.

1423
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:14,500
And for patients who were
not treated, but ended up

1424
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,462
dying due to sepsis, then
they're not censored.

1425
01:00:17,462 --> 01:00:19,670
And what I'll show you in
the later part of the class

1426
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,390
is how to learn
from censored data.

1427
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,620
So this is another
formalization which

1428
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,170
tries to address this
problem that we pointed out.

1429
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,740
Now, I call these hacks
because, really, I

1430
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:32,320
think what we should be
doing is formalizing it using

1431
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,200
the language of causality.

1432
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,820
Once you do this
introspection and you

1433
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,290
realize that there is
treatment, in fact,

1434
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,350
you should be rethinking
about the problem as one

1435
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,777
of now having three
quantities of interest.

1436
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:46,360
There's the patient, everything
you know about them at triage.

1437
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,430
That's the X-variable
I showed you before.

1438
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,440
There's the outcome,
let's say, Y.

1439
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,023
And then there's
that everything that

1440
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,190
happened in between, in
particular the interventions

1441
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,270
that happened in between.

1442
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,120
We'll call that
T, for treatment.

1443
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,850
And the question
that one would like

1444
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:04,030
to ask in order to figure
out how to optimally care

1445
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:08,440
for the patient is one of,
will admission to the ICU,

1446
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,690
which is the intervention
that we're considering here,

1447
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:15,550
will that lower the likelihood
of death for the patient?

1448
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,610
And now when I say lower,
I don't mean correlation,

1449
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,660
I mean causation.

1450
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,620
Will it actually lower the
patient's risk of dying?

1451
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,900
I think we need to hit
these questions on the head

1452
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,990
with actually thinking
about causality to try

1453
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,580
to formalize this properly.

1454
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,770
And if you do that,
this will be a solution

1455
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,110
which will generalize to the
high-dimensional settings

1456
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,450
that we care about
in machine learning.

1457
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:40,870
And this will be a topic that
we'll talk really in-depth

1458
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,960
after spring break.

1459
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,447
But I wanted to give you this
as one motivation for why

1460
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:46,530
it's so important-- there
are many other reasons--

1461
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,700
to really think about it
from a causal perspective.

1462
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,570
OK, so subtlety number 3--

1463
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,510
there's been a ton of hype in
the media about deep learning

1464
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,590
and health care.

1465
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,570
A lot of it is very
well warranted.

1466
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,340
For example, the
advances we're seeing

1467
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,390
in areas ranging from
radiology and pathology

1468
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:12,970
to interpretation of
EKGs are all really

1469
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,187
being transformed by
deep learning algorithms.

1470
01:02:16,187 --> 01:02:17,770
But the problems
I've been telling you

1471
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,110
about for the last
couple of weeks,

1472
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,180
of doing risk stratification on
electronic health record data,

1473
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,920
such as taxed notes,
such as lab test

1474
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,230
results and vital signs,
diagnosis codes, that's

1475
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,110
a different story.

1476
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,735
And in fact, if you look
closely at all of the papers,

1477
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:37,360
all the papers that
have been published

1478
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,058
in the last few years
that have been trying

1479
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:42,100
to apply the gauntlet of
deep learning algorithms

1480
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,923
at those problems, in fact,
the gains are very small.

1481
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:49,090
And so what I'm showing you
here is just one example

1482
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:50,210
of such a paper.

1483
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,510
This is a paper that received
a lot of media attention.

1484
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,852
It's a Google paper
called "Scalable

1485
01:02:54,852 --> 01:02:57,310
and Accurate Deep Learning with
Electronic Health Records."

1486
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,230
And if you go across
the United States,

1487
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,700
if you go
internationally, you talk

1488
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,610
to chief medical
information officers,

1489
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:04,120
they're all going to be
telling you about this paper.

1490
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,120
They've all read it,
they've all heard about it,

1491
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,217
and they all want to use it.

1492
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,550
But what is this actually doing?

1493
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,030
What's going on
behind the scenes?

1494
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:14,230
Well, this paper
uses the same sorts

1495
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,970
of data we've been
talking about.

1496
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:19,530
It takes vitals, notes,
orders, medications,

1497
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,417
thinks about it as a
timeline, summarizes it, then

1498
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:23,750
uses a recurrent neural network.

1499
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,870
It also uses attentional
architectures.

1500
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,046
And there's some pretty
smart people on this paper--

1501
01:03:28,046 --> 01:03:30,670
you know, Greg
Corrado, Jeff Dean,

1502
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,137
are all co-authors
of this paper.

1503
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:34,345
They know what they're doing.

1504
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:36,580
All right, so they use
these algorithms to predict

1505
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,808
a number of downstream
problems-- readmission risk,

1506
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:41,350
for example, 30-day
readmission, like

1507
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,710
you read about in your
readings for this week.

1508
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:49,150
And they see they get
pretty good predictions.

1509
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:53,513
But if you go to the
supplementary material, which

1510
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:55,930
is a bit hard to find, but
here's the link for all of you,

1511
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,390
and I'll post it to my slides.

1512
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:00,790
And if you look at
the very last figure

1513
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,740
in that supplementary
material, you'll

1514
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,670
see something interesting.

1515
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,490
So here are those
three different tasks

1516
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:08,115
that they studied--
inpatient mortality

1517
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:11,720
prediction, 30-day readmission,
length-of-stay prediction.

1518
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,240
The first line each
of these buckets

1519
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,330
is what your deep
learning algorithm does.

1520
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,230
Over here, they have
two different hospitals.

1521
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,772
I think it might
have been University

1522
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,700
of Chicago and Stanford.

1523
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,855
And they're showing the area
under the ROC curve, which

1524
01:04:24,855 --> 01:04:27,550
we've talked about,
performance for each

1525
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,997
of these tasks for
their best models.

1526
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:32,330
And in the parentheses, they
give confidence intervals--

1527
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,850
let's say something like 95%
confidence intervals-- for area

1528
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,640
under the ROC curve.

1529
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,560
Now, the second
line that you see

1530
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,900
is called full-feature
enhanced baseline.

1531
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,890
It's using the
same data, but it's

1532
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:48,190
using something very close
to the feature represetnation

1533
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,530
that you saw in the
paper by Narges Razavian,

1534
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,030
so that paper on
diabetes prediction

1535
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,430
that I told you about and
we've been criticizing.

1536
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,470
So it's using that
L1-regularized logistic

1537
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:00,400
regression with a
smart set of features.

1538
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,210
And what you see across
all three settings

1539
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:07,090
is that the results are not
physically significantly

1540
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:09,460
different.

1541
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,700
So let's look at the first
one, hospital A, deep learning,

1542
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,920
0.95 AUC.

1543
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,400
This L1-regularized
logistic regression, 0.93.

1544
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,570
30-day readmission,
0.77, 0.75, 0.86, 0.85.

1545
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:26,730
And the confidence intervals
are all overlapping.

1546
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,988
So what's going on?

1547
01:05:30,988 --> 01:05:33,030
So I think what you're
seeing here, first of all,

1548
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:37,680
is a recognition by the machine
learning community that--

1549
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,110
in this case, a late recognition
that simpler approaches

1550
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,940
tend to work well with
this type of data.

1551
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,740
I don't think this was the
first thing that they tried.

1552
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,032
They tried probably the deep
learning algorithms first.

1553
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:49,200

1554
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,150
Second, we're all
grasping at this,

1555
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,910
and we all want to come up
with these better algorithms,

1556
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,330
but so far we're
not doing that well.

1557
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,802
And I'll tell you more
about that in just a second.

1558
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,260
But before I finish
with the slide,

1559
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,247
I want to give you a punch line
I think is really important.

1560
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:05,830
You might come home
from this and say,

1561
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,260
you know what, it's
not that much better,

1562
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,510
but it's a little bit better--

1563
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,900
0.95 to 0.93.

1564
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,030
Suppose it was tight
confidence intervals,

1565
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,738
there might be a few
patients whose lives

1566
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:15,200
you could save with that.

1567
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,120
But because all the issues I've
told you about up until now,

1568
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,440
of non-stationary, for
example, those gains disappear.

1569
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,770
In many cases, they even
reverse when you actually

1570
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,850
go to deploy these models
because of that data set shift

1571
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,000
for non-stationarity.

1572
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,920
It so happens that
the simpler models

1573
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,590
tend to generalize better
when your data changes on you.

1574
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,920
And this is nicely
explored in this paper

1575
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,730
from Kenneth Jung and Nigam
Shah in Journal of Biomedical

1576
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,040
Informatics, 2015.

1577
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,420
So this is something that
I want you to think about.

1578
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,540
Now let's try to answer why.

1579
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,610
Well, the areas where
we've been seeing

1580
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,560
recurrent neural networks
doing really well--

1581
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,960
in, for example,
speech recognition,

1582
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,742
natural language processing,
are areas where, often--

1583
01:06:59,742 --> 01:07:01,200
for example, you're
predicting what

1584
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,880
is the next word in
a sequence of words,

1585
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,760
the previous few words
are pretty predictive.

1586
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,250
Like, what is the next
[PAUSES] that I'm going to say?

1587
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:08,780
What is it?

1588
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,630
AUDIENCE: Word.

1589
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,130
PROFESSOR: Word,
right, and you knew

1590
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:15,225
that, right, because it was
pretty obvious to predict that.

1591
01:07:15,225 --> 01:07:17,100
And so the models that
are good at predicting

1592
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,210
for that type of
data, it doesn't

1593
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,770
mean that they should
be good for predicting

1594
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:20,940
for a different type
of sequential data.

1595
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,170
Sequential data
which, by the way,

1596
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,850
lives in many
different time scales.

1597
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,580
Patients who are hospitalized,
you get tons of data for them

1598
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,560
at a time, and then
you might go months

1599
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,790
without any data on them.

1600
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,440
Data with lots of missing data.

1601
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,200
Data with multivariate
observations

1602
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,233
at each point in time,
not just a single word

1603
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,150
at that point in time.

1604
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,800
All right, so it's
a different setting.

1605
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,567
And we shouldn't expect that
the same architectures that

1606
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:42,150
have been developed
for other problems

1607
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:44,910
will generalize immediately
to these problems.

1608
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,710
Now, I do conjecture
that there are

1609
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,250
lots of nonlinear
attractions where

1610
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,960
deep neural networks
could be very

1611
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,220
powerful at predicting for.

1612
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,020
But I think they're subtle.

1613
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:58,380
And I don't think that we
have enough data currently

1614
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:03,270
to deal with the fact
that the data is messy

1615
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:05,940
and that the non-linear
interactions are subtle.

1616
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,470
We just can't find
them right now.

1617
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,690
But this shouldn't mean that
we're not going to find them

1618
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:10,565
a few years from now.

1619
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:13,590
I think this deservedly is
a very interesting research

1620
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,143
direction to work on.

1621
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:16,560
And a final reason
to point out is

1622
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,290
that the features that are
going into these types of models

1623
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:22,939
are actually really
cleverly-chosen features.

1624
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:26,609
A laboratory test result,
like looking at your A1C--

1625
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:28,200
what is A1C?

1626
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,470
So it's something that
had been developed

1627
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,050
over decades and decades of
research, where you recognize

1628
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,550
that looking at a
particular protein

1629
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,800
is actually informative as
something about a patient's

1630
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,550
health.

1631
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,189
So the features that we're
using that go into these models

1632
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:42,660
were designed--

1633
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,698
first, they were designed
for humans to look at.

1634
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:46,740
And second, they were
designed to really help you

1635
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,332
with decision-making, or
largely independent features

1636
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:51,540
from other information that
you have about a patient.

1637
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,082
And all of those
are reasons, really,

1638
01:08:53,082 --> 01:08:56,160
I think why we're
observing these subtleties.

1639
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,350
OK, so for the last
10 minutes of class--

1640
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,850
I'm going to have
to hold questions,

1641
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:01,808
because I want to get
through all the material.

1642
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:03,145
But please post them to Piazza.

1643
01:09:03,145 --> 01:09:04,750
For the last 10
minutes of class,

1644
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,720
I want to change
gears a little bit,

1645
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,350
and talk about
survival modeling.

1646
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,490
So often we want want to
talk about predicting time

1647
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,600
to some event.

1648
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,800
So this red dot here--

1649
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,740
sorry, this black line here
is what I mean by an event.

1650
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,299
That event might be, for
example, a patient dying.

1651
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:29,970
It might mean a married
couple getting divorced.

1652
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:35,649
It might mean the day that
what you graduate from MIT.

1653
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:39,330
And the red dot here
denotes censored events.

1654
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:42,960
So for whatever
reason, we don't have

1655
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,128
data on this patient, patient
S3, after time step 4.

1656
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:47,920
They were censored.

1657
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,270
So we do know that
the event didn't

1658
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,670
occur prior to time step 4.

1659
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,740
But we don't know
if and when it's

1660
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,510
going to occur
after time step 4,

1661
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,015
because we have
missing data there.

1662
01:10:00,015 --> 01:10:04,170
OK, so this is what I mean
by right-censored data.

1663
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,980
So you might ask, why not
just use classification--

1664
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,605
like binary classification--
in this setting?

1665
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:12,230
And that's exactly
what we did earlier.

1666
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:16,470
We thought about formalizing
the diabetes risk stratification

1667
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:20,400
problem as looking to see
what happens years 1 to 3

1668
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,690
after the time of prediction.

1669
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:26,075
That was with a gap of one year.

1670
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:27,450
And there a couple
of reasons why

1671
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,720
that's perhaps not what
you really wanted to do.

1672
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,490
First, you have less data
to use during training.

1673
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:40,920
Because you've suddenly
excluded patients for whom--

1674
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:48,300
or to differently--
if you have patients

1675
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,528
for whom they were censored
during that time window,

1676
01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:52,570
you're throwing them out.

1677
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:54,350
So you have fewer
data points there.

1678
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:58,160
That was part of our
inclusion/exclusion criteria.

1679
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,740
Also, when you go to
deploy these models,

1680
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,960
your model might say,
yes, this patient

1681
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,450
is going to develop type 2
diabetes between one and three

1682
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:07,990
years from now.

1683
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,470
But in fact what happened is
they develop type 2 diabetes

1684
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:13,240
3.1 years from now.

1685
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,750
So your model would
count this as a negative.

1686
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,390
Or it would be a false positive.

1687
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,253
The prediction would
be a false positive.

1688
01:11:21,253 --> 01:11:23,420
But in reality, your model
wasn't actually that bad.

1689
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,450
We did pretty well.

1690
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,130
We didn't quite get
the right range,

1691
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,410
but they did get
diagnosed diabetes right

1692
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,170
outside that time window.

1693
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,950
And so your measures
of performance

1694
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:34,020
are going to be pessimistic.

1695
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,618
You might be doing
better than you thought.

1696
01:11:36,618 --> 01:11:38,160
Now, you can try to
address these two

1697
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,180
challenges in many ways.

1698
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,220
You can imagine a multi-task
learning framework

1699
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,357
where you try to predict
what's going to happen one

1700
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:44,815
to two years from
now, what's going

1701
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:46,740
to happen two to three years
from now, three to four,

1702
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,305
and so on.

1703
01:11:47,305 --> 01:11:49,680
Each of those are different
binary classification models.

1704
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,640
You might try to tie
together the parameters

1705
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,860
of those models via a
multi-task learning formulation.

1706
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:57,042
And that will get you closer
to what you care about.

1707
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:59,250
But what I'll tell you about
in the last five minutes

1708
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,910
is a much more elegant approach
to trying to deal with that.

1709
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,620
And it's akin to regression.

1710
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,730
So that leads to
my second point--

1711
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,970
why not just treat this
as a regression problem?

1712
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,800
Predict time to event.

1713
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,170
You have some continuous
valued outcome,

1714
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:15,960
the time until
diagnosis diabetes.

1715
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,260
Just try to minimize
mean squared--

1716
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,910
minimize your
squared error trying

1717
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,610
to predict that
continuous value.

1718
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:26,190
Well, the first
challenge to think about

1719
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:28,170
is, remember where that
mean squared error loss

1720
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:28,962
function came from.

1721
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:33,630
It came from thinking
about your data

1722
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,930
as coming from a
Gaussian distribution.

1723
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,430
And if you do maximum likelihood
estimation of this Gaussian

1724
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,800
distribution, it
turns out to look

1725
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,100
like minimizing a squared loss.

1726
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,350
So it's making a lot of
assumptions about the outcome.

1727
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,490
For one, it's making
the assumption

1728
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,282
that outcome could be
negative or positive.

1729
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,960
A Gaussian distribution
doesn't have to be positive.

1730
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,540
But here we know that T
is always non-negative.

1731
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,427
In addition, there
might be long tails.

1732
01:12:56,427 --> 01:12:58,260
We might not know exactly
when the patient's

1733
01:12:58,260 --> 01:12:59,190
going to develop
diabetes, but we

1734
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,440
know it's not going to be now.

1735
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,640
It's going to be at some
point in the far future.

1736
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,480
And that may also look
very non-Gaussian.

1737
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,290
So typical regression approaches
aren't quite what you want.

1738
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,600
But there's another
really important problem,

1739
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,220
which is that if you naively
remove those censored points--

1740
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,553
like, what do you do for the
individuals where you never

1741
01:13:14,553 --> 01:13:15,540
observe the time--

1742
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,240
where the never get diabetes,
because they were censored?

1743
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,880
Well, if you just remove those
from your learning algorithm,

1744
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,560
then you're biasing
your results.

1745
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,390
So for example, if you
think about the average age

1746
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,612
of diabetes onset, if you only
look at people who actually

1747
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:32,070
were observed to
get diabetes, it's

1748
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,293
going to be much closer to now.

1749
01:13:34,293 --> 01:13:36,210
Because obviously the
people who were censored

1750
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:39,920
are people who got it much
later from the censoring time.

1751
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,040
So that's another
serious problem.

1752
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,957
So the way they we're
trying to formalize this

1753
01:13:43,957 --> 01:13:45,340
mathematically is as follows.

1754
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,800
Now we should think about
having data which has,

1755
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,270
again, features x, outcome--

1756
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,610
what we usually call Y for
the outcome in regression,

1757
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:55,277
but here I'll call
it capital T, because

1758
01:13:55,277 --> 01:13:56,850
of the time to the event.

1759
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:59,100
And now we have an
additional variable--

1760
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,220
so it's no longer a
two-point, now it's a triple--

1761
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:02,940
b.

1762
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,610
And b is going to be a binary
variable, which is saying,

1763
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,260
was this individual
censored-- was the time, t,

1764
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,590
denoting a censoring
event, or was it denoting

1765
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:12,380
the actual event happening?

1766
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,930
So it's distinguishing
between the red and the black.

1767
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:19,500
So black is b equals 0.

1768
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,940
Red is b equals 1.

1769
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:26,950
OK, so now we can talk
about learning a density,

1770
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,920
P of t, which I'll
also call f of t,

1771
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,020
which is the probability
of death at time t.

1772
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,660
And associated with
any density, of course,

1773
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,650
is the cumulative
density function,

1774
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,260
which is the integral from 0
to any point of the density.

1775
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,960
Here we'll actually look
at 1 minus the CDF, what's

1776
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,230
called the survival function.

1777
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:51,720
So it's looking at probability
of T, actual time of the event,

1778
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,823
being larger than some
quantity, little t.

1779
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,490
And that's, of course,
just the integral

1780
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,266
of the density from
little t to infinity.

1781
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,167
All right, so this is
the survival function.

1782
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,250
It's of a lot of interest.

1783
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,833
You want to know,
is the patient going

1784
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,262
to be diagnosed with diabetes
two or more years from now.

1785
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:08,970
So pictorially, what
you're interested in

1786
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:09,928
is something like this.

1787
01:15:09,928 --> 01:15:12,240
You want to estimate these
conditional distributions.

1788
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,250
So I call it
conditional because you

1789
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:18,420
want to condition on the
covariant to individual x.

1790
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,580
So what I'm showing
you, this black line,

1791
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,670
is your density, little f of t.

1792
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,950
And this white area
here, the integral

1793
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:31,430
from little t to infinity,
meaning all this white area,

1794
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,380
is capital S of t.

1795
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,910
It's the probability of
surviving longer than time

1796
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,430
little t.

1797
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:43,730
OK, so the first thing
you might do is say,

1798
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:46,520
we get these data,
these tuples, and we

1799
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,060
want to try to estimate
that function, little

1800
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,250
f, the probability of
death at some time.

1801
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,320
Or, equivalently, you
might want to estimate

1802
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:58,220
the survival time, capital S
of t, which is the CDF version.

1803
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,390
And these two are related to
another just by some calculus.

1804
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:06,040
So a method called the
Kaplan-Meier estimator

1805
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:10,280
is a non-parametric method
for estimating that survival

1806
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,070
probability, capital S of t.

1807
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,290
So this is the probability
that an individual lives

1808
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:17,150
more than some time period.

1809
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:20,420
So first I'll explain
to you this plot, then

1810
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,110
I'll tell you how to compute it.

1811
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,860
So the x-axis of
this plot is time.

1812
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:28,130
The y-axis is this survival
property, capital S of t.

1813
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:30,050
It's the probability
that an individual lives

1814
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:32,330
more than this amount of time.

1815
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:36,933
I think this x-axis is in days,
so 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000.

1816
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:39,350
This figure, by the way, was
created by one of my students

1817
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:42,800
who's studying a multiple
myeloma data set.

1818
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,930
So you could then ask, well,
under what covariants do you

1819
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,680
want to compute this survival?

1820
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,430
So here, this method
I'll tell you about,

1821
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:56,125
is very good for when you
don't have any features.

1822
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,500
So all you want
to do is estimate

1823
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,460
that density by itself.

1824
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,970
And of course you
could apply a method

1825
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,240
for multiple populations.

1826
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,490
So what I'm showing
you here is applying it

1827
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:05,740
for two different populations.

1828
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:08,040
Suppose there's just a
single binary feature.

1829
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,030
And we're going to apply
it to the x equals 0

1830
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,875
and to x equals 1.

1831
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,670
That gets you two
different curves out.

1832
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,790
But here the estimator is going
to work independently for each

1833
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:19,140
of the two populations.

1834
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,900
So what you see here
on this red line

1835
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,800
is for the x equals
0 population.

1836
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,820
We see that, at time 0, everyone
is alive, as you would expect.

1837
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:35,000
And at time 1,000,
roughly 60% individuals

1838
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,340
are still alive for time 1,000.

1839
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,480
And that sort of stays constant.

1840
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,495
Now you see that, for
the other subgroup,

1841
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:46,010
the x equals 1 subgroup, again,
time step 0, as you would

1842
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,810
expect, everyone is alive.

1843
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,180
But they survive much longer.

1844
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:53,343
At time step 1,000, over
75% of them are still alive.

1845
01:17:53,343 --> 01:17:55,760
And of course of interest here
is also confidence balance.

1846
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,900
I'm not going to tell
you how can you do that,

1847
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,820
but it's in some of
the optional readings.

1848
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,250
And by the way, there are
more optional readings given

1849
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,820
on the bottom of these slides.

1850
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,170
And so you see that there is
a statistically significant

1851
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,055
difference between x
equals 1 and x equals 0.

1852
01:18:09,055 --> 01:18:10,430
These people seem
to be surviving

1853
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,490
longer than these people.

1854
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:13,530
And you get that
immediately from this curve.

1855
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:15,240
So how do we compute that?

1856
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,630
Well, we take those
observed times,

1857
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:24,410
those capital Ts, and here
I'm going to call them just y.

1858
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:25,610
I'm going to sort them.

1859
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,280
So these are sorted times.

1860
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,680
And I don't care whether they
were censored or not censored.

1861
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,840
So y is just all of the times
for all of the patients,

1862
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,490
whether they are
censored or not.

1863
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,310
dK I want you think about as 1.

1864
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,310
It's the number of events
that occurred at that time.

1865
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,740
So if everyone had a unique
time of censoring or death,

1866
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,510
then dK is always 1.

1867
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:49,910
K is indexing one
of these things.

1868
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,430
n of K is the number
of individuals

1869
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:56,930
alive and uncensored
by the K-th time point.

1870
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:01,160
Then what this estimator
says is that S of t--

1871
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,200
so the estimator at
any point in time--

1872
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,190
is given to you by
the product over K

1873
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:10,010
such that y of K is
less than or equal to t.

1874
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:14,570
So it's going over the
observed times up to little t,

1875
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,810
of 1 minus the ratio of 1 over--

1876
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,430
so I'm thinking about dK as 1--

1877
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,070
1 over the number of people
who are alive and uncensored

1878
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,860
by that time.

1879
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,510
And that has a very
intuitive definition.

1880
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,300
And one can prove that
this estimator gives you

1881
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,270
a consistent estimator
of the number of people

1882
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,620
who are alive--

1883
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,370
sorry, the number of survival
probability at any one

1884
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:41,547
point in time for censored data.

1885
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:42,380
And that's critical.

1886
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:45,020
This works for censored data.

1887
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,340
So I'm past time today.

1888
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,520
So I'll finish the last few
slides on Tuesday's lecture.

1889
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
So that's all for today.

1890
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,070
Thanks.

1891
01:19:54,070 --> 01:20:07,000
