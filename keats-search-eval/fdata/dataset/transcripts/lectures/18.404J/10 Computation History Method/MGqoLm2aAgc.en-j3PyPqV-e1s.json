  "description": "MIT 18.404J Theory of Computation, Fall 2020\nInstructor: Michael Sipser\nView the complete course: https://ocw.mit.edu/18-404JF20\nYouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60_JNv2MmK3wkOt9syvfQWY\n\nQuickly reviewed last lecture. Defined configurations and computation histories. Gave the computation history method to prove undecidability. Showed that acceptance problem for LBA is decidable; emptiness problem for LBA, PCP, and ALL for CFG are undecidable.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
