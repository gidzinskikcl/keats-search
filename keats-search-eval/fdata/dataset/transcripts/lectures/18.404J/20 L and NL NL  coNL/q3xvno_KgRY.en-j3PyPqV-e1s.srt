MICHAEL SIPSER: Hi, folks.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,290
Welcome back.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,580

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,320
So we will continue our
discussion that we had--

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,180
that we've been doing for
the past few lectures.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,750
We first talked about
time complexity.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,430
And then we shifted gears to
talk about space complexity.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,460
So we had a couple of
lectures on PSPACE,

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,510
kind of culminating in proving
that there were languages which

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,330
are PSPACE complete,
namely this TQBF language,

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,870
which is where we started.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,840
And then we also proved that
there are problems involving

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,710
games, such as the generalized
geography game, where

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,840
determining which side
has a winning strategy

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,610
is PSPACE complete.

20
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,770
At the end of the
lecture last time,

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,670
we moved to a different
regime of space,

22
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,790
namely from polynomial
space down to log space.

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,910
And we introduced
the classes L and NL.

24
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,820
And so I'm going to
begin today's lecture

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,330
by reviewing some of the
material on N and NL,

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,760
which I think came a little
too quickly last time.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,620
And then we have two
important theorems

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,370
we're going to cover today.

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:45,860
One is about proving that there
are complete languages for NL

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,190
that has a bearing on the
L versus NL question--

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,500
log space,
deterministic log space,

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,990
versus nondeterministic
log space.

33
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,120
That's yet another unsolved
problem in our field.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,950
And so there is a notion of
a complete problem for NL.

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,080
And then we're going
to prove a theorem that

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,610
was, in its day, very
surprising to people.

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,570
I remember when it
came out in the 1980s,

38
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,770
that NL, in fact, is closed
under complementation,

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,680
that the NL class and coNL
class both collapse to 1,

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,230
that they're equal, which
is not the way we believe

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,660
the situation to be for NP.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,530
But until someone has a
proof that they're different,

43
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,010
strange things can happen.

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,450
OK.

45
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,340
So with that, I will move
myself into the corner.

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,230
And let's do our review.

47
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:53,260
So we are-- in order to talk
about space complexity classes

48
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,000
that are smaller than n, we
had to introduce a new model,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,610
which was the two-tape model,
where there was a read-only

50
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,090
tape that had the input on it,
which you normally would think

51
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,920
of something very large--

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,890
the whole internet,
or something so big

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,460
that you can't read it
into your local memory.

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,130
And then you have a work tape,
which is your local memory.

55
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,540
And the way we're going to think
about it in the context of log

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,900
space is that that work tape
is logarithmic in the size

57
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,890
of the input.

58
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,780
And that is enough to have
small counters or pointers

59
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,100
into the input, because a
reference location of the input

60
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,710
is just--

61
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,450
you only need log
n bits to do that.

62
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:57,630
So we gave a couple of
examples of the L and NL--

63
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,580
of L and NL languages, so
this language of ww reverse,

64
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,590
as you may remember.

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,200
So here is an input
in ww reverse.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,340
It's a string follow-- it's
a palindromic string, which

67
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,350
is of even length.

68
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,440
And so you can make a
machine in log space here

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,230
that can test whether its
input is of that form.

70
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,050
And the work tape is only--

71
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,850
all it needs is a
pointer into the--

72
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,250
or a couple of
pointers that refer

73
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,860
to the corresponding
places of the input

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,630
that you're looking
at at the moment.

75
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,940
So you maybe start
out looking at the two

76
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,190
outside a's and then the b
symbols that are next to that.

77
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,270
And you can write
down on your tape

78
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,950
where you're looking currently.

79
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,920
And so that's going
to be enough for you

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,250
to-- you may have to zigzag,
of course, back and forth a lot

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,500
in order to do that test.

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,710
But that's completely
fine, using the model.

83
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,260
We're not going to
be measuring time.

84
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,920
We're only going to be focusing
on how much space we're using.

85
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,400
Another example that we
gave is the PATH language,

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,830
where you're given a
graph, and a start node,

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,580
and a target node.

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,710
And you want to know, is there
a path in this directed graph

89
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,600
that goes from s to t?

90
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,840
And that's the
language that's also--

91
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,030
that language is in NL--

92
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,420
in fact, not known to be in L.

93
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,900
So the way that
would look, shifting

94
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,280
to an input in
the PATH language,

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,410
you would have a
graph represented,

96
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,550
say, by a sequence of edges,
and a start, and a target.

97
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,348
And the work tape would keep
track of the current node.

98
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,890
So the nondeterministic
machine would

99
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,180
guess a path that takes you
from s to t, node by node.

100
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,870
And the work tape would keep
track of the current node.

101
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,180
OK, so I hope you have this--

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,120
develop a little bit of an
intuition for these classes,

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,020
L and NL.

104
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,810
We're going to be spending
the entire lecture today

105
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,050
talking about that.

106
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,700
OK.

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,800
So as I mentioned, the L and NL
problem is an unsolved problem.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,730
And it's very much analogous
to the P versus NP problem,

109
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,770
except, as I mentioned,
as we'll show,

110
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,680
that NL and its
complement end up

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,390
being the same, which
is not something

112
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,960
that seems to be the case
for NP, though we don't know.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:37,760

114
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,382
Can we think of this as a
multi-head Turing machine?

115
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,590
I'm getting a question about
that, which is, I think,

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,760
you can.

117
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,450
In fact, that's an alternative
way that people look at it.

118
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,210
You can think of it as
having multiple-- you know,

119
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:56,980
a head basically needs log
space to store the location--

120
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,350
to store the location of
where that head would be.

121
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,230
So if you imagine having several
different heads on the input

122
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,720
tape, you can think
of a log space machine

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,730
as being sort of
a Turing machine

124
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,070
that has multiple heads
on the input table.

125
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,590
It's equivalent.

126
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,840
Good question.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,870
So let's move on, then.

128
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,450
OK.

129
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,510
So one of the things we proved
last time was that anything

130
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,460
that you can do in L, you can
also do in polynomial time.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,190
And I'll answer some of these
chat questions in a minute.

132
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,160
But the-- so the class
L is a subset of P.

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,110
This is easy to prove.

134
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,800
But I think it's nevertheless
important to see why it's true,

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,080
because it sort of sets
some definitions of things

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,910
that we're going to use later.

137
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:59,710
So in particular, we
really need to know

138
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,380
the notion of a configuration
of a log space machine

139
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,330
on an input.

140
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,080
So because the input
does not change,

141
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,780
we don't really
consider the input

142
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,490
to be part of the configuration.

143
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,390
The only thing that's--

144
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,490
the thing that's relevant
in the configuration

145
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,400
is the dynamic part of the
machine-- the state, the head

146
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,150
locations, and the
work tape contents.

147
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,550
So we're defining
that the configuration

148
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,650
for the machine on a
particular input, w,

149
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,289
is those four things--

150
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,200
state, the two head locations,
and the tape contents.

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,110
And the important thing to
keep in mind for this theorem

152
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,380
is that we have only
a polynomial number

153
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,640
of different configurations if
you just do the calculation.

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,730
The main part is the number
of different tape contents

155
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,460
as you can have, which is
exponential in the log n.

156
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,230
And that's a polynomial.

157
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,340
And so therefore, any machine
that runs in log space,

158
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,440
provided it always
holds, and we always

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,590
assume our machines
always hold, they

160
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,860
can only run for a
polynomial number of steps,

161
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,460
because that's as many different
configurations as they have.

162
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,940
If they ran for, say, an
exponential number of steps,

163
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,330
they would have to be
repeating configurations.

164
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,160
And then they would be looping.

165
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,860
OK, so there we go.

166
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,380

167
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,840
OK, so let me just get back--
so somebody asked me a question.

168
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,880
Which is harder?

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,790
P versus NP or L versus NL?

170
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,160
Completely no idea.

171
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,770
It's a-- I guess there was a
common line of thinking that

172
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,570
if you're going to--

173
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,038
that it's good to
try to think about--

174
00:09:56,038 --> 00:09:57,580
if you're trying to
separate classes,

175
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,100
you might as well take
classes that are as far

176
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,740
apart as one another.

177
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,020
Like, if you're
trying to prove--

178
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,290
if you're comparing P different
from NP and P different

179
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,440
from PSPACE, maybe P
different from PSPACE

180
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,510
might be easier, because P and
PSPACE seem to be even further

181
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,850
apart than P and NP.

182
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,730
Nobody knows.

183
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,420
And I suspect that
there's something

184
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,480
fundamental about computation
that we just don't understand.

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,510
And then once somebody
makes a breakthrough

186
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,350
and solves one of those
problems, a lot of them

187
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,010
are going to get
solved in short order.

188
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,770
But again, it's
purely speculation.

189
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,700
OK, d.

190
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,190
What is d here? d would be
the size of the tape alphabet.

191
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,660
OK, so this is the number
of different tape contents

192
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,230
we have.

193
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,570

194
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,350
Good.

195
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,150
All right.

196
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,560
So let's continue on.

197
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,050
Another thing we mentioned
kind of quickly in passing,

198
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,910
but still an important fact,
is that Savitch's theorem

199
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,100
works down to the
level of log space--

200
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,660
same exact proof.

201
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,920
So that means that
nondeterministic log space

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,215
is contained in deterministic
log squared space,

203
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,340
because that's what Savitch's
theorem does for you.

204
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,730
It converts
nondeterministic machines

205
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,500
to deterministic
machines at the cost

206
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,840
of a squaring in the
amount of space you need.

207
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,710
And so I'm not going to
go through this in detail.

208
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,510
But the same picture that I
copied off an earlier slide

209
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,890
with a simple modification
is that instead of--

210
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,210
that I'm right down--

211
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,565
the size of the configuration
is going to be now log n,

212
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,440
because that's how big
the configurations are

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,800
when you have a nondeterministic
log space machine.

214
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,990
And so simulating that--

215
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,130
so this would be what
the tableau would

216
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,970
look like for an NL machine.

217
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,850
And then you can simulate
that in the same way

218
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,840
by trying all
possible intermediates

219
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,733
and then splitting it,
doing the top half and then

220
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:17,400
the bottom half.

221
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,363
We're using the space,
of course, recursively.

222
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:24,030
The amount of space
you're going to need

223
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,040
is going to be enough to store,
for one level of the recursion,

224
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,630
one configuration.

225
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,460
And that's order log space.

226
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,680
And then the number
of levels of recursion

227
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,510
is going to be another
factor of log n,

228
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,970
because that's log to
the running time, which

229
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,470
is going to be exponential in
log n, which is polynomial.

230
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,870
So the total amount of
space that you would need

231
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,048
would be log squared space.

232
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:49,590
Again, this is sort of saying
the proof of Savitch's theorem,

233
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,520
just over again.

234
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,100
So if it's coming
too fast for you,

235
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,310
just review the proof
of Savitch's theorem

236
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,880
and observe that it works,
even if the amount of space

237
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,810
that the machine--

238
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,000
that the nondeterministic
machine starts off with

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,050
is log space.

240
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,240

241
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,610
All right.

242
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,820
And last thing I was going
to-- last thing in the category

243
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:22,330
of a review is our theorem that
not only is all of L within P--

244
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,760
and that's kind of
trivial, kind of immediate.

245
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,710
You don't even have
to change the machine.

246
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,870
If you have a log space
machine for some language,

247
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,057
the very same machine is
a polynomial time machine

248
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,640
for that language,
because it can only

249
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,570
be running for a
polynomial amount of time.

250
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,290
But now, we have a
nondeterministic machine

251
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,850
for some language.

252
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,130
We're going to have
to change it to become

253
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,320
a deterministic machine that
runs in polynomial time.

254
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,850
And so we're going to give a
deterministic polynomial time

255
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,660
simulation of a nondeterministic
log space machine.

256
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,510
And we kind of did this last
time, but a little quickly.

257
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,490
So now, if we have some
nondeterministic log space

258
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:15,010
machine, so an M, which decides
the language A in log space,

259
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,960
we're going to show
how to simulate

260
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,130
that machine with a
deterministic polynomial time

261
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,450
machine.

262
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:28,210
And the key idea, which
is going to come up

263
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,830
in a later theorem, so good to
understand it not only here,

264
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,870
but to understand it for the
next theorem that's coming,

265
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,540
is the notion of a
configuration graph.

266
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,400
I was sort of thinking about
calling it a computation graph.

267
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,980
But now, on further
reflection, I

268
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,940
think configuration graph maybe
is the more suggestive term.

269
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,200
So let's stick with that.

270
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,430
So a configuration graph
for a machine on an input

271
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,130
is just a set of
all configurations

272
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,350
that the machine has, all
the possible different

273
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,950
configurations the
machine can have,

274
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,790
with edges connecting
configurations that correspond

275
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,140
to legal moves of the machine.

276
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,630
So here is some configuration.

277
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,540
This is a snapshot of the
machine at a moment in time.

278
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,710
Here is some other
configuration,

279
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,840
another snapshot of the
machine at a moment n time.

280
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,080
And you're going to draw
an edge between ci and cj

281
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,440
if cj could follow
in one step from ci.

282
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,080
And you could tell by just
looking at the configurations

283
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,000
whether that could be possible.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
Obviously, the head has
to be one place over in cj

285
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,610
from where it was in ci.

286
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,350
And it has to be
updated according

287
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,920
to the rules of the machine.

288
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,930
So you can tell whether--

289
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,150
so you could fill
out this graph.

290
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,970
You could write down all
the possible configurations.

291
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,010
And you can put the edges down.

292
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,970
Now, the point is that when
we have a log space machine,

293
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,120
we don't have too many
possible configurations.

294
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,490
There's only a
polynomial number.

295
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,390
So the size of this whole
graph is polynomial.

296
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,950

297
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,710
So our polynomial
time simulation

298
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,730
is going to write down
that entire configuration

299
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,420
graph of the log space
machine on its input.

300
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,920
There [INAUDIBLE]
many configurations.

301
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,170
There can be only
polynomially many.

302
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,260
So you can write down all those
configurations as the nodes

303
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,240
and then go look at
each pair of nodes,

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,990
whether this configuration could
lead to that configuration.

305
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,400
According to-- it's a
nondeterministic machine.

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,250
So a configuration could go to
several different locations--

307
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,790
there could be several
different ways to go.

308
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,130
But those are just several
different outgoing edges

309
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,890
from a particular node in
this graph representing

310
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,600
the configuration,
which might have

311
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,550
several different
legal successors

312
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,910
in the nondeterministic
computation.

313
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,480
OK.

314
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,950
Now, the important thing here
is that M accepts its input, w,

315
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,500
exactly when there
is a path [INAUDIBLE]

316
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,569
configuration graph
that takes you

317
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,050
from the start configuration
to the accept configuration.

318
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,790
And as I mentioned,
let's assume,

319
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,383
as we've been doing,
that the machine--

320
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,050
I should have put it
here, but I didn't.

321
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,790
But the machine, when
it is about to accept,

322
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,080
it erases its work tape
and moves both of its heads

323
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
to the home position at
the left end of the tape.

324
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,840
So there's just one
accepting configuration

325
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
you have to worry about.

326
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,965
It just makes life simpler.

327
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:39,450

328
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,430
So there's going to be
a start configuration,

329
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,780
a single accept configuration
in this configuration graph.

330
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,180
And now there's going to be
a path, indicated here, that

331
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,870
connects the start configuration
to the accept configuration

332
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,510
if and only if M accepts
w, because that path

333
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,760
is the sequence
of configurations

334
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,310
that the machine
would go through

335
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,560
if you launched it on w.

336
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
It would start at the start.

337
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,700
And there might be several
different ways to go.

338
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,760
But if there is one of them
that leads you to an accept,

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,400
that's going to correspond to
a branch of the computation

340
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,010
that it's accepting.

341
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,140
OK, so that tells us what the
polynomial time algorithm is.

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,870
On input w, you construct
that configuration graph for M

343
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,540
on w, G sub Mw.

344
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,440
And you test whether there's
a path from c start to c

345
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,370
accept using any polynomial
time depth-first search

346
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,420
or breadth-first search
algorithm for testing

347
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,990
whether there's a
connection path in a graph.

348
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,300
And if there is such
a path, you accept,

349
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,060
because that means the
machine M accepted.

350
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,110
And if there was no path,
you reject, because then M

351
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,540
must have not accepted.

352
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,500
And therefore, you have a
polynomial time simulation

353
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,190
of your nondeterministic
log space machine M, OK?

354
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,910
How are we doing?

355
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,610
OK, so that tells us that
NL is contained within P.

356
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,010
And also, L is contained
within NL, as before.

357
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,495
So we have kind of this
hierarchy of classes.

358
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:29,710

359
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,890
Now, you can even talk
about, not only is L

360
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,100
different from NL, even
is L different from P?

361
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,020
Is it possible that
anything that you

362
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,750
can do in polynomial time,
you can do [INAUDIBLE] space?

363
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,252
Don't know.

364
00:19:42,252 --> 00:19:42,835
Open question.

365
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:49,800

366
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,520
OK, getting a very good
question here just now.

367
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,220
Why is this construction
taking log space?

368
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,610
It doesn't.

369
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,220
This construction
takes polynomial time.

370
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,990
This algorithm here
is not a polynomial--

371
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,450
this is not a log space
algorithm that I'm giving you.

372
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,340
I'm giving you a
polynomial time algorithm

373
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,250
for simulating a
nondeterministic log space

374
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,640
machine.

375
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,790
Now, later on-- I don't want
to confuse the issue right now.

376
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,450
For this particular
slide, all I need to do

377
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,890
is construct that graph
in polynomial time.

378
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,330
It's a polynomial size graph.

379
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,270
I can't store that whole
graph in a log space memory.

380
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,380
OK, so question here--

381
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,220

382
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,550
we can see that listing
out the nodes and edges

383
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,680
would be polynomial time.

384
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,502
But how do we actually
provide structure

385
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:50,710
to this graph representation?

386
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,130
I don't even know
what that means.

387
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,913
So if you can
clarify that for me,

388
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,330
then maybe I can
try to answer it.

389
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,640
But a graph is just a list
of nodes and a list of edges.

390
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,430
After that, we know
what the graph is.

391
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,160
I mean, you may like a picture.

392
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,280
But the machine
doesn't need a picture.

393
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,330
Our definition of-- we
just represent these things

394
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,390
as strings, in the end.

395
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,750
So please clarify
if you want me to--

396
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,560
I'll answer it the
next at the next pause.

397
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm grateful for all the
questions, because I'm sure,

398
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,560
any question that any of
you have, another 20 of you

399
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,220
also have.

400
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,800
So questions are good.

401
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,460
Don't be bashful.

402
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,840
And also ask the TAs
if I become overloaded.

403
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,130
OK, now we're going to shift
gears into some new material.

404
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,900
All right.

405
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,900
We're going to talk
about the notion that--

406
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,410
sort of thinking about,
analogous to the P versus NP

407
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,920
problem, where there were
these NP-complete problems,

408
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,440
now we have the L
versus NL problem.

409
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,120
There are going to be
an NL-complete problems

410
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,500
that kind of capture the
essence of NL the way

411
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,080
NP-complete problems
capture the essence of NP,

412
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,230
in a sense, in that all
of the problems in NP

413
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,650
are reducible to them.

414
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,770
So they're kind of like
the hardest NP problems.

415
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,200
Here, we're going to have
exactly analogous situations

416
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,270
for NL, where we're
going to show problems

417
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,120
where all other NL problems
are reducible to them.

418
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,390
So if you can kind
of solve one of them,

419
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,080
like solve one of these
NL-complete problems in log

420
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,380
space deterministically, then
you solve all of NL problems

421
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,460
in log space deterministically.

422
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,940
So it's a very
similar-looking definition

423
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,900
to what we had before.

424
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,230
It's NL complete if it's in NL.

425
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,450
And then all other languages
in NL should be reducible.

426
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,510
But now, we have a new notion
here, with an L instead of a P.

427
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,690
Now, before, when we talked
about NP completeness,

428
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,880
we had polynomial
time reducibility.

429
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
That's not going
to work anymore,

430
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,970
because if you remember,
NL is a subset of P.

431
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,870
So all NL languages
are polynomial--

432
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,260
are languages in P. And
if we're talking about--

433
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,840
if we use polynomial
time reducibility,

434
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,100
all languages in P are
reducible to each other.

435
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,670
We need to have a notion
of reducibility which is

436
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,190
kind of weaker than the class.

437
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,490
And so polynomial
time reducibility just

438
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,980
would not work here,
because everything

439
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,170
would become NL complete,
because everything

440
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,442
is reducible to each other.

441
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:50,900
So we need to have
a weaker notion.

442
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,080
We're going to use log
space reducibility,

443
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
which we have to define.

444
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,220

445
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,050
So here, for that,
we're going to have

446
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,390
to talk about the
notion of a function

447
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,170
that you can compute
in log space.

448
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,200
And it's a little tricky here.

449
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,570
Just like when we talked
about language recognition

450
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,880
in log space, where
we had the work tape

451
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,550
had to be smaller
than the input tape,

452
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,140
because the inputs can be large.

453
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,000
The work area is small.

454
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,300
Now the output
also could be large

455
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
relative to the work area.

456
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,130
So we're going to have a
three-tape model, where there's

457
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,400
the input is going
to be a read-only,

458
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,000
the output is a write-only--
it's like a printer.

459
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,740
It's something you
can only write on,

460
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,698
but you can't read back,
because otherwise, you

461
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:44,030
could cheat by using the
output as a kind of storage.

462
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,880
And then you have your
storage area, which

463
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,100
is your read-write work tape.

464
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,890

465
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,570
OK, so this-- we'll call this--

466
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,070
the traditional name of this
is a log space transducer.

467
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,770
So it converts
inputs to outputs,

468
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,630
but uses only log space
for its working memory.

469
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,740
OK, so the input tape
stores n bit-- n symbols.

470
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,360
The work tape stores log n
symbols, order log n symbols.

471
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,670
And then we have
the output tape.

472
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,380
You may want to
think about how big--

473
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,240
there's going to be a check-in
coming to kind of ask you,

474
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,760
how big could the output be?

475
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,790
But we'll save that
for the end if you--

476
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,110
you can mull that over if
you want to think ahead.

477
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,320
OK.

478
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,860
So we think of a
log space transducer

479
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,680
as computing a
function, which is just

480
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,480
a mapping from the
input to the output

481
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,486
that the transducer
provides for you.

482
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:50,720
A transducer is a deterministic
machine, by the way.

483
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,320
So you take the transducer.

484
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,240
You give it w.

485
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,190
And you turn it on.

486
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,950
And then it halts with f
of w on its output tape.

487
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,545
That's what it means to be
computing the function f, OK?

488
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:13,730
And we'll say that A is log
space reducible to B, using

489
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,720
the l subscript symbol on the
less than or equal to sign,

490
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,810
if it's mapping reducible
to B, but by a reduction

491
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,670
function that's
computable in log

492
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,440
space, just the
same way we define

493
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,060
polynomial time reducibility.

494
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,360
But there, we insisted that
the reduction function was

495
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,680
computable in polynomial time.

496
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,640

497
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,140
OK.

498
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,900
Just quickly, I got
a question again.

499
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,500
Why log space here?

500
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,870
Because polynomial time would
be too powerful for doing

501
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:56,240
reductions internal to
P. Every language in P

502
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,580
is reducible to every
other language in P.

503
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,030
And so everything in NL would
be reducible to everything else

504
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,060
in L with a polynomial
time reducibility.

505
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,430
And so that would not be
an interesting notion.

506
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,110
We have to use a weaker
notion than that, a weaker

507
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,570
kind of reduction,
using a weaker model,

508
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,060
so that you don't get--

509
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,710
otherwise, the
reduction function

510
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,970
would be able to
answer whether--

511
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,617
would be able to solve
the problem A itself

512
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,200
if we had a polynomial
time reduction,

513
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,900
and we're mapping things from
NL to other problems in NL.

514
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,630
The reduction would
solve the problem.

515
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,420
And that's not what you want.

516
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,570
The reduction should
be constrained only

517
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,430
to be able to do simple
transformations on the problem,

518
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,350
not to solve the problem.

519
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,910
Anyway, you have
to look at that.

520
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,140
This is an issue that's come
up before when we talked about,

521
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,700
what's the right
notion of reduction

522
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,390
to use for PSPACE completeness?

523
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,760
Same exact discussion.

524
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,990
OK.

525
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,060
Now, there is an
issue here, though,

526
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,470
that we have to be careful of.

527
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:16,700
When we have A being log space
reducible to B, and B in L,

528
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,615
then what you want--

529
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:22,400

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,640
if A is log space
reducible to B and B in L,

531
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,920
then you want A
to be in L. That's

532
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,830
the same pattern we've
always had for reductions.

533
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,480
If A is reducible to B, and
B is easy, then A is easy.

534
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,730
So here, the notion of
easy is being an L. Now,

535
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,130
if you remember the proof
of that we had from before,

536
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,700
which I'll just
put out for you, is

537
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:57,630
that to show a log space solver
for A, you take an input, w.

538
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,280
And now, if A is reducible to
B, you compute the reduction.

539
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,640
And then you run
the decider for B.

540
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,430
So if we're assuming A is
reducible to B, and B is in L,

541
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,490
so B has a log
space decider, you

542
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,650
take your w, which you
want to know, is it in A?

543
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,110
You map it over to a B problem
using the reduction function.

544
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,480
And then you solve it
using the decider for B.

545
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,840
And you give the same answer.

546
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,620
Now, this actually
doesn't work anymore,

547
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,780
or it doesn't work
in an obvious way,

548
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,590
because, if you're
following me--

549
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,770
I hope most of you are--

550
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,502

551
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,650
there is a problem here, which--

552
00:29:50,650 --> 00:30:01,700
because we're trying to give
a log space algorithm for A.

553
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,510
And that algorithm is going
to be computing this reduction

554
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,660
function, mapping w to f of w.

555
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,020
f of w might itself
be very large,

556
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,150
as this picture suggests here.

557
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,780
You may not be able
to store f of w

558
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:30,020
in the log space memory for
the machine that's deciding A.

559
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:37,260
So this is an
obstacle that we need

560
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,300
to solve in order to prove
this theorem, which we need,

561
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
because that's the whole
justification for doing

562
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,380
these reducibilities--

563
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,830
should be a familiar-looking
kind of line

564
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,750
to what we've seen before.

565
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,570
So we don't have
space to store f of w.

566
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,830
What do we do?

567
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,675
And I'll also
mention that this is

568
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,925
going to be relevant to one
of your homework problems.

569
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,210

570
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,120
So what do we do?

571
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,210
We don't have space to store
the intermediate result

572
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,130
that we need in order
to solve the problem.

573
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,720
We started with w.

574
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,360
Now we'd need to test
if f of w is in B.

575
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,040
That can run in log space.

576
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
But just simply getting
your hands on f of w--

577
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,840
what do you do about that?

578
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:30,100
So what we're going to do is
the following, is the decider--

579
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:38,280
the decider for B,
which needs f of w,

580
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,820
because it's deciding
if f of w is in B--

581
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,510
it doesn't need all of f of w
sitting there in front of it

582
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,890
all at once.

583
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,620
If you think about how the
Turing machine operates

584
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,970
on its input, it only looks
at one symbol at a time.

585
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,693
It starts out reading the
leftmost symbol of f of w,

586
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,110
then maybe it moves
its head right

587
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,240
and moves to the second
symbol of f of w,

588
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,590
then the third symbol of f of w.

589
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,245
Maybe it gets up to the
10th symbol of f of w.

590
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:08,620
Maybe it moves his head back
and goes to the ninth symbol

591
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,700
and the eighth symbol.

592
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,230
But the Turing machine's
head, which is deciding B,

593
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,490
only looks at one symbol
of f of w at a time.

594
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,310

595
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,760
So instead of writing
down all of f of w,

596
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,280
the idea is that we
are going to compute

597
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,020
the individual symbols of
f of w that we need only

598
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,510
at the moment we need them.

599
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,180
So if the decider
for B is reading

600
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:59,240
the 10th symbol of f of w, we
fire up the transducer on w.

601
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,550
And as it's writing
out its output, which

602
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,140
we don't have space
to store anymore,

603
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,410
we throw away all
of the output values

604
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,870
until we get to the 10th one.

605
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,230
And then we say, ah, the
10th one is whatever,

606
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,900
is a c, whatever the value is.

607
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,310
Now we feed that into
the decider for B.

608
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,617
We can now simulate that
decider for one more step.

609
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:24,200
Now the decider says,
all right, now I

610
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,440
need the 11th symbol of f of w.

611
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,000
OK, now we can run that
machine for one more place.

612
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,140
But if it needs--

613
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,570
but we don't even have to do it.

614
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,720
I think the better way to
think about it is, every time

615
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,870
that decider for B
needs another symbol,

616
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,510
we start the transducer
over again and just keep--

617
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,270
throw away everything except
for that one symbol output

618
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,600
that we need.

619
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,500
So every time we do another
step of simulating B,

620
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,100
we're going to have to rerun the
transducer from the beginning,

621
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,900
just to recompute
that, or compute maybe

622
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,840
for the first time, or recompute
it if we need it subsequently.

623
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,610
This is going to be
slow, but we don't

624
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:20,380
care, to recompute that
symbol that the simulator--

625
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,580
that the decider
for B requires, OK?

626
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,900
So I'm saying that over here.

627
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,730
Recompute the symbols
of f of w as needed.

628
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,920
OK, so let me-- let's take
a couple of questions.

629
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,712
And then we're going
to move to a check-in.

630
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:42,790

631
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,820
So somebody's asking, why did
we have to introduce transducer

632
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,770
for log space
reducibility when we

633
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,870
didn't do it for polynomial
time reducibility?

634
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,300
We could have for polynomial
time reducibility.

635
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,659
But we didn't need to, because
we could just all do it

636
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,190
on the same tape.

637
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,310
The problem is, for log
space, the tape is--

638
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,750
the work tape is too small to
hold the input on the output.

639
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,100
So we can't-- since
we're only working--

640
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,040
we have a log n bound that
we have to work within.

641
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,460
We need to separate
those functions

642
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,950
from the work functions, the
input function and the output

643
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,940
function.

644
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,440
So if we have more than the
amount of resource we have,

645
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,272
either time or space
was at least n,

646
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:26,980
then we could just
lump them all together

647
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:33,242
and have that one tape
do multiple functions.

648
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,700
And somebody's
asked me here, yeah,

649
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,980
this is mapping
reducibility, this m.

650
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,170
This is from the
notion we saw before.

651
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,030
OK.

652
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,420
Does f of w lie on
the input tape of B?

653
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,340
Well, yes.

654
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,400
So we are-- good question.

655
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,040
So f of w--

656
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,620
you know, because
what are we doing?

657
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,650
We're trying to
find a decider for A

658
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,670
here, using the decider for
B and the mapping from A

659
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,534
to B, the reduction from A to B.

660
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:14,170
So the decider for B
expects to find its input

661
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,990
on an input tape.

662
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,760
That input is
going to be f of w.

663
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,440

664
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,010
But we have to get
the effect of that

665
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,380
without actually writing
down that input tape,

666
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,760
because we don't
have enough room

667
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,580
to write down the input
tape for the decider--

668
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,730
for the B decider, because
that could be very large.

669
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,190
And we only have--

670
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,850
we have no place
to put the f of w.

671
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,350
So think about
what's going on here.

672
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,690
We're making a log space
machine whose input

673
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,850
is w, has to compute f of
w as an intermediate value,

674
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,930
to feed it into the B decider.

675
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:58,640
That is not going to be possible
to hold onto that whole f of w

676
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,810
at one--

677
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,400
altogether, because
it's too big.

678
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,060
But that doesn't matter.

679
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,768
We don't need it.

680
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:05,424
We only needed one symbol at a
time, which we can recompute.

681
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,150

682
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,650
OK, so let's see.

683
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:15,570

684
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,310
So somebody says,
can we just ensure

685
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,900
that the output tape
is order n so we

686
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,778
don't need to use more
tape than the input?

687
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:22,320
Order n is still
going to be too big.

688
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,945
Where are you going
to put that output?

689
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,770
Even if it's just
order n-- first of all,

690
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,080
the answer is no, we
can't, because there

691
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,340
are going to be reductions
which are bigger than that.

692
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,960
But the other question
is, can we just

693
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,910
ensure that the
output is order n?

694
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,520
You can't put the output
on the input tape.

695
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,990
The input tape is read-only.

696
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,450
The output tape is write-only.

697
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,012
So there's no place to--

698
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,970
even if the output is
just as big as the input,

699
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,650
it doesn't help you.

700
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,170
If the output is only log
n, OK, then we could do it.

701
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,650
But that's not going to
be interesting for us.

702
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,110
You're going to need,
for these large space

703
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,160
reductions, big outputs,
as we'll see in a minute.

704
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,510

705
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,330
What's the running time for
this log space reduction?

706
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,680
It's all going to be polynomial.

707
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,000
It's all going to be
a log space algorithm.

708
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,777
So it's all going
to be polynomial.

709
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:15,760

710
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,290
Is there any NP
completeness reduction

711
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,430
which can be done in log space?

712
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,350
All of the NP--

713
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,620
all typical NP
completeness reductions,

714
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,600
those polynomial time
reductions, they all

715
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,650
can be done in log
space, because they are--

716
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,910
reductions tend to be very
simple transformations.

717
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,310
And log space is going to
be enough to do all of them.

718
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:47,920

719
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,870
OK.

720
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,010
I can't answer the
second part of that.

721
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,970
That's too complicated.

722
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,020
And I think we should move on.

723
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,925
So let's look at the
first check-in here.

724
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,590

725
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,680
So if we have a long
space transducer that

726
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,940
computes f, and if you
feed it inputs of length n,

727
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,180
how big can the
outputs be, actually?

728
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,617

729
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,950
So why don't you think about
that and give me an answer?

730
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,700
I'll give you a minute
to answer this question.

731
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,610
Oh, this is a tough one.

732
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,990
Let me just say up
front, there are--

733
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,680
I struggle with this lecture,
because some-- especially the

734
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,620
stuff in the second
half, it's kind of hard.

735
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,500
I wouldn't say it's technical.

736
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,900
But conceptually, I think
some of the material

737
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,320
is a little harder,
maybe in part

738
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,360
because people are
not used to thinking

739
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,990
about memory complexity
or space complexity,

740
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,420
even though I don't see why--

741
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,170
I mean, I think it's
an important resource

742
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,310
to be considering.

743
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,740
But I think it's less common.

744
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,350
And I think there's some
discomfort with that.

745
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,800
OK, so we're just
about done here.

746
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,120
Five more seconds, please.

747
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,260

748
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,540
All right, about to wrap.

749
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,950
Wrap the check-in.

750
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,540
1, 2, 3.

751
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,680
All right.

752
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,590
So yes, the correct answer is c.

753
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,830

754
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,850
As I mentioned,
we're going to want

755
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,360
to have outputs that
are larger than log n.

756
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,580
And there's no reason
why they wouldn't

757
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,550
be able to be larger than log
n, according to the definition

758
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,660
that I gave you.

759
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,090
There's no bound on the output.

760
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,830
We're only measuring the
running space of this algorithm

761
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,170
in terms of its work tape.

762
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,200
The input and output
tapes don't count.

763
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,680
So they can be more than log n.

764
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
They can be more than n.

765
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,190
Polynomial is the right answer.

766
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,900
Why?

767
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:02,260
Because a log space transducer,
if you just ignore the output,

768
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,180
is just an ordinary
log space machine.

769
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,930
And it can only run for a
polynomial number of steps

770
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,090
without it end up
going into a loop.

771
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,860
The same argument
that we gave for that

772
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,170
before applies here as well.

773
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,770
So if it's going to exceed a
polynomial number of steps,

774
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,730
it's never going to hold.

775
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,680
And so that's going to be--

776
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,750
not allow it-- it's got to halt
with the output on the output

777
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,250
tape.

778
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:33,320
And so it'll be disqualified
as a log space transducer

779
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,610
if it doesn't halt. So it
can't be anything longer

780
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,290
than polynomial.

781
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,340
It's a good thing to think
about, to understand.

782
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,940
OK, so let's continue.

783
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,960
So we're going to show that the
PATH problem is NL complete.

784
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,420
Now, we defined NL completeness.

785
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,070
And we've seen the
PATH problem before.

786
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,980
And we're now going to show
that PATH occupies a very

787
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,100
special position for
NL, namely that it's

788
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,555
an NL-complete problem.

789
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,880

790
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,880
So if you can solve the PATH
problem deterministically

791
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,775
in log space, you have
gotten a big result.

792
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:16,350
No one knows how to do that.

793
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,430
And it would collapse
all of NL down

794
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,940
to log space if you could
do PATH in log space

795
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,202
deterministically.

796
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:28,410
OK, so let's see why that is.

797
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,660
So first of all, the two
components of being complete

798
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,850
are being in the language
and the reduction part.

799
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,480
So in the language,
we've shown already.

800
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,710
Now, we want to show that
for any other language in NL,

801
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,210
it's going to be log
space reducible to PATH.

802
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:51,710
In a certain sense, this
may not feel so surprising,

803
00:42:51,710 --> 00:43:00,360
thinking back to our proof
that NL is a subset of P,

804
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,950
because we managed
to convert any NL

805
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:12,880
machine, the running of any
NL machine, to a PATH problem

806
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,150
that the polynomial time
machine then solved.

807
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:23,220
And so it's really the same
idea that says that PATH really

808
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:31,800
captures any NL machine.

809
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,170
The computation
of any NL machine

810
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,350
really can be seen as
a PATH problem, where

811
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,200
the nodes are the
configurations of the machine.

812
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,360
So let's just see how--

813
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,370
let me just try to go
through that if that

814
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,480
wasn't super clear, which
I'm not sure it was.

815
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,450
So suppose we have a
machine decided by--

816
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,290
a language decided by a
nondeterministic-- an NL

817
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:00,048
machine, a nondeterministic
machine in log space.

818
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:01,590
Again, I should have
put this before.

819
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,842
But we're going to modify
M to erase its work tape

820
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,800
and move its head to the
left end on accepting.

821
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,600
So it has a unique
accepting configuration.

822
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,830

823
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:19,510
Now I'm going to give it
the log space reduction that

824
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:26,980
maps our language A, which is
in NL, to the PATH language.

825
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,570
So thinking about
what that means,

826
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:33,250
I'm going to take an input, w,
which may or may not be in A,

827
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,320
and produce for you a graph with
a start and target node, start

828
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:46,130
and target notes, where w is
going to be in the language

829
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,770
if and only if G has
a path from s to t.

830
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,770
And what do you think
that graph is going to be?

831
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,570

832
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,430
That's going to be
the configuration

833
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:06,300
graph for the machine
that decides A, OK?

834
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,840
So that is how
it's going to look.

835
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,090
So maybe here's a picture.

836
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,080
Right.

837
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,170
So f of w, where w, again, is
your problem about membership

838
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,570
in A, is going to
become a problem

839
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,900
about membership in PATH.

840
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,250
And it's just going to be the
configuration graph for M on w.

841
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,950

842
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,940
Now, what's left is to show
that we can do this conversion

843
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,650
with a log space transducer.

844
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,650
So it's a log space
computable reduction.

845
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,200

846
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,210
So let's just try to go
through that quickly--

847
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,960
conceptually, not super hard.

848
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,338
So here's our transducer.

849
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,130
Let's just think about
what it needs to do.

850
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,670
It needs to take an input,
w, and convert that f

851
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,580
of w to this thing here--

852
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,740
computation graph of M on w--

853
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,620
the configuration
graph M on w, the start

854
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,950
and accept configuration.

855
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,320
So that's going to look
like this down here.

856
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,700
That's what we want
to eventually appear

857
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,690
on the output tape.

858
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:26,350

859
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,170
So the way we're going
to achieve that-- we only

860
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,610
have a small log space,
order log space work tape.

861
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,520
And the way we're going to be
able to produce this output

862
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,120
is--

863
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:43,900
the configuration graph is just
a series of edges, which are--

864
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,790
say, you can go from
this configuration

865
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,690
to that configuration
in one step.

866
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,590
So what we're going to
do is, on our work tape,

867
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,770
we're going to go through
all possible pairs

868
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:58,570
of configurations, again, just
in some like odometer order,

869
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,930
just by looking at all possible
strings, really, of length

870
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,910
order log n that are
big enough to represent

871
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:04,815
two configurations.

872
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:06,190
Every once in a
while, it's going

873
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,530
to be actually a pair
of configurations.

874
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,920
At that point, we look at those
two configurations, look at M,

875
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,040
and see, can this configuration
go to that configuration?

876
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,440
If yes, you print it
out on the output tape.

877
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,058
If no, you just move on to the
next pair of configurations.

878
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:24,100
And then, at the end, you
write down on the start

879
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,390
and accept configurations.

880
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,620
So I've indicated that here.

881
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,050
Here is the transducer.

882
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:33,310
It says, on input w, for all
pairs of configurations, that--

883
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,890
now, this is getting written
down on the work tape--

884
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,650
you output those pairs
which are legal moves for M.

885
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,900
And then finally, you output
the start and the accept.

886
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,030
That's it.

887
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,590
So let's just see.

888
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,925
Let me take any questions here.

889
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:49,140

890
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,200
Why do we need special
accept state for M?

891
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,520
Well, we want to have--

892
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,680
I think you mean
accepting configuration.

893
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,820
I just want to have a--

894
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,470
I don't want to
have a multiplicity

895
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,600
of different possible
accepting configurations,

896
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,658
because then it's not
really a PATH problem.

897
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:04,950
Then it becomes a question
of, can I get from the start

898
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,520
to one of those
nodes representing

899
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,290
accepting configurations?

900
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,610
That's a little messy.

901
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,540
I could fix it.

902
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,550
But the simplest
fix is just to make

903
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:19,760
there be a single
accepting configuration.

904
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,900
Well, why do I output
start and accept

905
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,150
at the end of the output tape?

906
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,480
That's the way I write
down my PATH problem.

907
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,210
It's a graph, followed by a
start node and a target node.

908
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,550
So I have to follow that form.

909
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,080
I'm not sure what you're asking.

910
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,180
You want me to put that first?

911
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,200
I'm not sure what the--

912
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,270
or why at all?

913
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,988
Because it has to be a--

914
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:44,820
here it is.

915
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,237
Here's the output
I'm looking for.

916
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:49,110

917
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:49,610
OK.

918
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,360

919
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,560
Do the three-- do
the read-write work

920
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,230
tape here store pointers
to configuration

921
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,670
or some sort of counter?

922
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,670
No, they store the
actual configuration.

923
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,883
The configuration for M is--

924
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:10,050
just think about what it is.

925
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,250
It's a log space size object.

926
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,830
It's a tape for
M. It's a location

927
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:19,780
of its heads and its state.

928
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,270
So you could kind of write down
that stuff right over here,

929
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,160
on the left side of this--

930
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,162
this left slot.

931
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,620
And on the right
slot, you're going

932
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,280
to write another
configuration for M on w.

933
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,250

934
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,106
And you're going to just put
the edges in accordingly.

935
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,840

936
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,700
OK, so somebody-- did that help?

937
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,400
Somebody, again, is asking, why
is the configuration only log

938
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,670
space?

939
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,590
It's just a tape.

940
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,260
It's a log space tape.

941
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,230
That's the main thing in the
configuration of the tape.

942
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,365
On the read-write
work tape, do we only

943
00:49:56,365 --> 00:49:57,740
write two
configurations at once?

944
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,240
Yeah.

945
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,100
We're just writing
down a candidate edge

946
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
that we're going to output
onto the output tape.

947
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,018
So that's why we have
two configurations.

948
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:07,060
I want to know, can I get
from this configuration

949
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,110
to that configuration?

950
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,930
If yes, I print it out,
print out that pair.

951
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,650
That's an edge in
my configuration

952
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,440
graph, which is what I'm
supposed to be outputting here.

953
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,300
Can there be multiple--

954
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,990
OK, why don't we move on?

955
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,790
Again, direct
questions to our TAs,

956
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:32,110
who would be more than
happy to help you.

957
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,480
And we will-- let
me just quickly

958
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,170
give-- we're running a
little tight here time-wise.

959
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,210
But let's just see.

960
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,090
Here's an example of showing
some other problem is

961
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,200
NL complete.

962
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,700
You have a homework
problem on that.

963
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,575
So I thought I wanted
to give you an example.

964
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:50,410
Maybe we can just defer
this to the recitation.

965
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,320
So maybe we'll try to do this
a little quickly to save us

966
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,820
on time.

967
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:59,650
But the 2SAT problem, which
is just like the 3SAT problem,

968
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,530
except with two
literals per clause--

969
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,540
curiously, the complement
of that problem,

970
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:10,750
so the unsatisfiable
formulas, that

971
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,620
form an NL-complete language.

972
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,110
And so first of all, you
have to show it's in NL.

973
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,250
We're not going to do that.

974
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,125
It's a nice exercise.

975
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,990
It's not totally trivial to do.

976
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:28,820
But you might want to try that.

977
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,860
We're going to show that PATH
is reducible to the complement

978
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,170
of 2SAT.

979
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,920
We've got to give a reduction
that converts graphs

980
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,060
to formulas, where there is a
PATH, now, when the formula is

981
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,740
unsatisfied.

982
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:51,160
And what's going to
happen is the PATH

983
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,740
is going to correspond to
a sequence of implications

984
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,670
in the formula, which
yields a contradiction

985
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:04,790
and forces it to be unsatisfied.

986
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,090
Again, this is going
to come a little fast.

987
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,420
And then maybe we can discuss it
over the break, which is next.

988
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,520
So every node in G is
going to have associated

989
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,200
variable in the formula.

990
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,250
So there's a variable for
every one of the nodes.

991
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,050
For every edge,
there's going to be

992
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:28,130
a clause of implication
connecting those two

993
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,190
associated nodes.

994
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,550
So if there's an
edge from u to v,

995
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,000
then there's going to be an
implication in the formula that

996
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,190
says, if xu is true,
then xv is true.

997
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,880
And note that that's equivalent
to the more conventional way

998
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,750
[INAUDIBLE] xu complement or xv.

999
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,140
These are logically equivalent.

1000
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:55,170
So I'm not cheating you here in
terms of being a 2SAT problem.

1001
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,920
They really just look like this.

1002
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,050
And lastly, I'm going to
put two additional clauses.

1003
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,180
It's [INAUDIBLE] x for
the start variable--

1004
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,640
from the start node, s--

1005
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,140
here, s.

1006
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,180
I want to force
that one to be true.

1007
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,320
So it's x-- since I want to
have exactly two per clause,

1008
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,970
that's xs or xs.

1009
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,790
So that forces x--

1010
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,760
that variable true.

1011
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,620
And lastly, if t is true,
that's going to force the--

1012
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,880
if xt is true, that's going
to force xs to be false.

1013
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,120

1014
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,310
So now, if there's actually
a path in the graph that

1015
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,150
goes from s to t,
there's going to be

1016
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,690
a sequence of implications,
starting now with s being true,

1017
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,750
forcing other things
being true, including

1018
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,740
forcing t to be true, which
then forces s to be false.

1019
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,920
And that's our contradiction,
which shows that the formula

1020
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,000
cannot be satisfied.

1021
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,020

1022
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,860
So now, you have to
prove that this works.

1023
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,300
As I said, for the forward
direction, if there is a path,

1024
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,880
you follow the implications
to get a contradiction.

1025
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,260
For the reverse-- let
me not spend time here.

1026
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,470
I'll leave this to you
to think about offline.

1027
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,390
But if there is
no path, there is

1028
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:29,010
a way of assigning the
variables to true and false

1029
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,280
to make a satisfying
assignment to the formula.

1030
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,810
So that gives the
other direction, OK?

1031
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,660

1032
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,250
And you can show it's
computable in log space.

1033
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,840
That's very simple, because
a very simple transformation

1034
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,410
there, OK?

1035
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,015
So I think we're going
to move on to the break.

1036
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:53,390

1037
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:59,175
And I'm happy to take questions
at this point about this.

1038
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:02,020

1039
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,740
Does the configuration, going
back, include the input?

1040
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,400
No.

1041
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,110
The configuration does not--

1042
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,320
as I said, the
configuration for M on w

1043
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,700
is the state, the head
positions, and the work tape

1044
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,370
contents, not the input tape,
because then you would be--

1045
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,630

1046
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,250
it's not there for a reason.

1047
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,000
The input is huge.

1048
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,520

1049
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,047
But you don't need
the input there,

1050
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,380
because the input is going
to be constant for everybody.

1051
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,230
Everybody can look at that
input, which is a fixed, sort

1052
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,310
of external thing.

1053
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,810

1054
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:45,940
Somebody's asking me, are
there NP-complete problems in--

1055
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,990
there are definitely
NP-complete [INAUDIBLE]..

1056
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:57,740
I don't know-- there are some
problems in number theory where

1057
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,670
it's--

1058
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,950
like factoring, where we
don't know the status,

1059
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:05,300
somewhere between P
and NP, formulated

1060
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,530
as a language, of course.

1061
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,580
But there are
problems in solving

1062
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:17,670
certain kinds of equations,
low-degree equations,

1063
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,050
that I don't remember now
if [INAUDIBLE] actually

1064
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,050
known to be NP complete.

1065
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,895
Now, you asked about NL
complete [INAUDIBLE]..

1066
00:56:27,895 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't know if there are
NL-complete number theory

1067
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,700
problems.

1068
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,480
Oh, good question.

1069
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,820
Somebody's asking
me, does NL also

1070
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,280
have an alternative
definition using

1071
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,380
certificates or witnesses?

1072
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,940
Yeah.

1073
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,300
Yes, sort of.

1074
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:51,530

1075
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,650
For NL, you can make a
certificate, which is, again,

1076
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,170
polynomial size certificate.

1077
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,020
But it has to be--
you're only allowed

1078
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,950
to read it with a one-way head.

1079
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,590
So it's like a
one-way certificate.

1080
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,380
So it has to be-- you can only
process it in a certain way.

1081
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,100
That's a nice exercise,
actually, itself.

1082
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,780
But anyway, let us--

1083
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,230
we are now done.

1084
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,730
And we're going to move back.

1085
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,080
We're going to continue.

1086
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,355
So everybody return.

1087
00:57:28,355 --> 00:57:31,340

1088
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:37,770
This is what's
next on the agenda,

1089
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,200
proving that NL equals coNL.

1090
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,310
This is a hard proof.

1091
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:44,540

1092
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,090
I'm going to try to break
it down as much as I can.

1093
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:51,350
And let's hope you get--

1094
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,852

1095
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,400
I hope you get it.

1096
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,460
I'll try to be as
helpful as I can.

1097
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,690
OK.

1098
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:04,640
But if you're finding it
tough, you won't be alone.

1099
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:11,235
So first of all,
we're going to show--

1100
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,610
the way we're
going to solve this

1101
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,580
is by showing that
the complement of PATH

1102
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:21,190
is solvable in NL, because
the complement of PATH is--

1103
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,490
just as PATH is complete
for NL, the complement

1104
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,610
is complete for coNL.

1105
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,690
And so by doing
that problem in NL,

1106
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:34,390
we're going to reduce
all of-- all of coNL

1107
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,390
will be reducible
to problems in NL.

1108
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,640
And so therefore,
we'll be in NL. coNL

1109
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,140
will be then inside NL.

1110
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,980
And then NL is going
to be equal to coNL.

1111
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:50,950
If that sequence of logical
connections, is not clear.

1112
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:51,580
Don't worry.

1113
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,270

1114
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:58,280
The point is that we want
[INAUDIBLE] go back and figure

1115
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,690
out why that's enough later.

1116
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,420
But what this means
is we want to give

1117
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,870
a nondeterministic
machine, which

1118
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:12,830
will accept when there
is no path from s to t.

1119
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,330
OK?

1120
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,910

1121
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,010
And please don't
say, why don't we

1122
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,520
just take the machine for
PATH and flip the answer?

1123
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,640
You can't do that with a
nondeterministic machine.

1124
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,580
So you better-- if you're
thinking that that's allowed,

1125
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,950
go back and review
nondeterminism.

1126
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,490
So you want to make a
nondeterministic machine, which

1127
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,200
is going to accept
when there's no path.

1128
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,110
So some branch is going to
make a sequence of guesses.

1129
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,720
And it has to be sure
that there's no path.

1130
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,520
And then it's going to be--

1131
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,980
and then it can accept
when there's no path.

1132
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,440
Now, if you can find a way
of like making a separator,

1133
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,190
something that cuts the graph
in half and separates s from t,

1134
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,180
then you would be good.

1135
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:59,290
The only problem is there's
no obvious way of doing that,

1136
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:01,270
because those kind
of separators,

1137
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,730
even if they were
[INAUDIBLE] probably too

1138
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,720
big to write down in log space.

1139
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,420
So I'm going to give you
a completely different way

1140
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,930
of doing it.

1141
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:18,470
And I'm going to make-- this is
a little different presentation

1142
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,550
than what's in the book.

1143
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,790
I think hopefully, this is a
little longer, and therefore,

1144
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,780
a little clearer.

1145
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,920
We'll see.

1146
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,570
So first of all,
I'm going to define

1147
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:32,480
a notion of a nondeterministic
machine computing a function.

1148
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,110
And that's a simple idea.

1149
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:38,240
What you want is, on
the different branches--

1150
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,000
so you have some function,
f, which has, for every w,

1151
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,710
there's an output, f of w.

1152
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,290

1153
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,590
And the nondeterministic
machine can

1154
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:54,660
operate that on all
of its branches,

1155
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:01,080
it's allowed to either give f of
w or say reject, meaning punt,

1156
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,150
or say, I don't know.

1157
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:07,770
So every branch has to
give the right answer.

1158
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,170
So all the branches that
give an answer have to agree,

1159
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,940
because there's only
one right answer.

1160
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,800
All the branches
that give an answer

1161
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:20,300
have to give the right answer,
or they can say, I don't know.

1162
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,120
The only thing is you have
to also say that at least one

1163
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,880
of the branches actually
gives an answer.

1164
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,270
So somebody cannot reject.

1165
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,710
Somebody cannot
say, I don't know.

1166
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,820

1167
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,030
So at least one of the
branches gives an answer and--

1168
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,920
gives the answer.

1169
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,040
And all the other branches
can either give the answer,

1170
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,890
or they can say--

1171
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,010
they can just reject.

1172
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,480
But there's no
notion of accepting.

1173
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,870
There's just a notion of this
nondeterministic machine,

1174
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:55,330
on some branches,
giving the output value,

1175
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:59,528
and other branches just
punting and saying reject.

1176
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:00,820
Maybe reject is the wrong word.

1177
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,750
I could just say punt.

1178
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,320

1179
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,580
All right.

1180
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,800
So we're going to be talking
about functions that you

1181
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,960
can compute with
nondeterministic machines,

1182
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:19,100
with NL machines in particular.

1183
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:19,690
All right?

1184
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,670
So we're going to look at
this path function now.

1185
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,190
Now, this is not exactly the
same as the PATH language.

1186
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:30,550
This is a function here,
written with lowercase.

1187
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:33,700
So given a graph,
s and t, I'm going

1188
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:37,515
to say yes if there is a path
and no if there's no path.

1189
01:02:37,515 --> 01:02:38,890
And this is a
function now, which

1190
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:44,338
is going to output yes
or no, not a language.

1191
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:45,130
This is a function.

1192
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,230
It's very closely related.

1193
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,730
I understand.

1194
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,500
So if you can
solve the function,

1195
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,900
you can do the language.

1196
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,980
But what we're going to
give is a NL machine,

1197
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,480
a nondeterministic
machine, which is

1198
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,772
going to compute this function.

1199
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:01,280

1200
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,435
And therefore, you can use
that to do the PATH language.

1201
01:03:04,435 --> 01:03:07,390

1202
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:11,740
Two important things for us
is, if G is some graph, well,

1203
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,410
here's the starting node, s.

1204
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,070
R is all of the nodes
that you can reach from s.

1205
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,700
This is some
collection of nodes.

1206
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,700
And c, which stands
for count, is

1207
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,030
the number of reachable nodes.

1208
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,890
So I've written that
down here more--

1209
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,260
if you like it more formally.

1210
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,880
R is the number--

1211
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,180
is the collection of
nodes for which there's

1212
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,860
a path from s to the node.

1213
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:44,058
And c is the size of R. So you
have to understand these two,

1214
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:45,850
because we're going to
be playing with this

1215
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:46,933
for the next three slides.

1216
01:03:46,933 --> 01:03:51,510

1217
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,560
OK.

1218
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,600
Now, first of all, this is kind
of a little bit of an exercise

1219
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,100
theorem.

1220
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,225
But it's still going to be
a useful fact that we're

1221
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:00,270
going to end up needing later.

1222
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,610
But it's also a
little bit of just

1223
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,750
to test your understanding.

1224
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,380
Suppose there's some
NL machine which

1225
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,746
computes this path function.

1226
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:17,160
So on the different branches
of the nondeterminism,

1227
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,510
given a graph, G,
s, and t, there

1228
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:24,120
are going to be some branches
which may output yes,

1229
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,620
or some branches
that may output no.

1230
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,412
And other branches
might say, I don't know.

1231
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:30,528
But the machine always has to
give the right answer if it's

1232
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:31,570
going to give any answer.

1233
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:35,740
So all branches either have
to say yes, or all branches--

1234
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,150
all branches have
to say yes or punt,

1235
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,810
or all branches have
to say no or punt,

1236
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:47,710
because one of those answers is
going to be the right answer.

1237
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:51,420
So suppose I have a way
of computing path by an NL

1238
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,160
machine.

1239
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,440
Then can I also compute the--

1240
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,360
can I make some other
NL machine which

1241
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,680
computes the count, the
number of nodes reachable?

1242
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,800
So if I can test if
a node is reachable,

1243
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,890
can I figure out how
many nodes are reachable?

1244
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,120
This is supposed to be easy.

1245
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,570
This is kind of a little
bit of a practice.

1246
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,630
So if I can figure out
if nodes are reachable,

1247
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,850
yes or no, then I
can say, figure out

1248
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,440
how many nodes are reachable.

1249
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,750
You just go through
them one by one,

1250
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,080
testing if they're reachable,
and count the ones that are.

1251
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,590
That's all I have in mind.

1252
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,810
So start with a counter
that's set to 0 initially.

1253
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:38,600
And go through each of
the nodes of G one by one.

1254
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,620
And I use my NL machine
that computes path.

1255
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,350
That's what I mean by this part.

1256
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,580
So I test it.

1257
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:51,470
If the NL machine says
yes, there is a path,

1258
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,300
then I increase the counter.

1259
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,020
And if it says there's
no path, then I just

1260
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,460
continue without
increasing the counter.

1261
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,620
Now, when I'm
running my NL machine

1262
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,820
to compute this function,
that NL machine might punt,

1263
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,520
might reject sometimes
on some branches.

1264
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,540
That's OK.

1265
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,700
I'm also allowed.

1266
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,780
I'm also an NL machine.

1267
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:16,940
I'm computing a value.

1268
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:20,470
And I also might punt
on some branches.

1269
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,200

1270
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,110
So at the end, I'm going
to output that count, OK?

1271
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:31,700
So what I'm going to prove
next is the converse of this.

1272
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,040
And that's-- and that's
the magical hard part,

1273
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:39,680
that if I can compute the
count, then I can do the test

1274
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,490
of whether individual nodes are
connected, have a path from s.

1275
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:51,000

1276
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,140
OK, so let's just see.

1277
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:56,230

1278
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:01,180
Somebody is asking if
nondeterministic machines--

1279
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,010
so like M is not
allowed to loop?

1280
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,000
No.

1281
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,520
If a machine, if any
one of these machines,

1282
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,940
like an NL machine, loops,
it's going to be going forever.

1283
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,120
That's not allowed.

1284
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,160
So no looping.

1285
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:19,468
I'm not sure why that's
relevant, but no looping.

1286
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,010
But what I'm more
worried is that you

1287
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:24,593
understand this theorem here.

1288
01:07:24,593 --> 01:07:26,010
I think we have a
check-in coming.

1289
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:26,510
Let's see.

1290
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:29,630

1291
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,170
OK.

1292
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,087
This might be helpful.

1293
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:34,390

1294
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:38,010
So consider the statement
that PATH complement is NL.

1295
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:40,930
That's what we're
trying to prove,

1296
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,845
and also that some NL machine
can compute the path function.

1297
01:07:44,845 --> 01:07:50,770

1298
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:55,580
These are going to
be related facts.

1299
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:59,047
Which one can we prove
from the other easily?

1300
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:00,630
I mean, they're both
going to be true.

1301
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:02,210
So in some sense, it's trivial.

1302
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,460
But I want to know,
which one can we

1303
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,790
prove kind of immediately
without doing much work?

1304
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:11,510
That I can solve this
PATH problem in NL,

1305
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,460
the complement of the
PATH problem in NL,

1306
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,640
or that I can compute
the path function in NL?

1307
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,939
So what do you think?

1308
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:24,590
OK, almost done here?

1309
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:25,855
Yeah.

1310
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:26,355
Ending.

1311
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:32,000

1312
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,700
You guys didn't do well.

1313
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,200
That's OK.

1314
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,890
Actually, the right answer is c.

1315
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:44,330
Most of you got that if I can
solve the path function, so

1316
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:48,740
the yes-no value, I can use that
now to solve both PATH and PATH

1317
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,069
complement.

1318
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:54,500
That seems more clear cut.

1319
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,819
But suppose I can solve the
PATH complement problem in NL.

1320
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:02,270
And I also know I can solve
the PATH problem in NL.

1321
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:05,880
That, we've already shown.

1322
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:12,210
So knowing both of those, if
I'm given a G, s, and t, what

1323
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:15,600
I can do is
nondeterministically pick which

1324
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,830
of those two directions.

1325
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:18,970
You know, I pick--

1326
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:22,300
I'm going to guess,
well, it's in PATH,

1327
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,840
or it's in the
complement of PATH.

1328
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,520
So there are two different
nondeterministic ways to go.

1329
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,917
One of those is going to
always end up rejecting.

1330
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,500
And so that's going
to end up punting.

1331
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,569
The other direction is
going to sometimes end up

1332
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:36,579
accepting and sometimes punting.

1333
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:39,826
And based upon whether
which side ends up--

1334
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,784
one or the other is going
to have some accept--

1335
01:09:41,784 --> 01:09:44,529

1336
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:46,029
is going to be accepting.

1337
01:09:46,029 --> 01:09:48,609
And so the one
that's accepting is

1338
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:51,069
going to tell me whether
to answer yes or no.

1339
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:55,750
So actually, both
directions, both implications

1340
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,100
follow pretty easily.

1341
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,510

1342
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,100
OK.

1343
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:06,200
Anyway, let's try to show--

1344
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,208
this is the hard part.

1345
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,250
And we have five minutes.

1346
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,380
Let's see how far we can get.

1347
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,050
So this theorem works by magic.

1348
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,510
So it kind of blew everybody's
mind when it first came out.

1349
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,260
So let's just see.

1350
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,790
It's really not that hard.

1351
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:28,180
But it's sort of--

1352
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,055
it's kind of twisted.

1353
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:32,310

1354
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,080
So suppose some
machine can compute

1355
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,790
c, the count, the
number reachable from s.

1356
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:45,990
I'm going to use that to
solve path, the path function,

1357
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:51,930
to test, yes, I can output
yes if there is a path

1358
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:55,920
or no, there is no
path, for each node t.

1359
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,780
So if I know how many
nodes are reachable,

1360
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:05,400
then I can solve now for
individual nodes, which is

1361
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,630
strange that you can do that.

1362
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,700
Now, I'm not telling
you how to compute c.

1363
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,460
That's for later, which
I probably won't get to.

1364
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,820
But just pretend we
can somehow figure out

1365
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:24,570
what the count is of the
number of reachable nodes, OK?

1366
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:33,350
So here is my nondeterministic
algorithm for computing path.

1367
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:37,720
First, I'm going to compute
c, or let's say c is given.

1368
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:42,730
And now, maybe the
best thing to do

1369
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,912
is to try to give you
the idea up front.

1370
01:11:46,912 --> 01:11:49,370
What we're going to do, since
we're a little short on time,

1371
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:55,860
what we're going to do
is, suppose I tell you,

1372
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:01,020
there are, in this graph,
100 nodes reachable from s.

1373
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,650
So c is 100.

1374
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,850
There's 100 reachable nodes.

1375
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,530
Now I want to know--

1376
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,900
I say, well, I don't really--

1377
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,950
that's all very nice.

1378
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,860
But I'd like to know
this particular node, t.

1379
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:16,270
Is that reachable from s?

1380
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:19,000
Now, I'm a
nondeterministic machine.

1381
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,190
Now, if t was
reachable, then I'd

1382
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,990
be fine, because
nondeterministically, I

1383
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,550
don't even care about the 100.

1384
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:31,800
I take, nondeterministically,
on some branch, starting from s,

1385
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,420
I'm going to hit t.

1386
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:36,000
And that branch is
going to say yes.

1387
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,850
The other branches,
maybe they'll punt.

1388
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,340
But some branch is going
to get the right answer.

1389
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,250
The problem is, suppose
t is not reachable.

1390
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,800
Then you want some
branch to say no.

1391
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,170
And how could that
branch ever say no,

1392
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:54,080
unless it's sure that
t is not reachable?

1393
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,770
And how can one branch be sure?

1394
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,270
The idea is this.

1395
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:03,020
Suppose I know that there
are 100 reachable nodes.

1396
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,770
What I'm going to do
nondeterministically is I'm

1397
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:10,362
going to guess those
100 nodes, one by one.

1398
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:12,320
You can't store them all,
because it could be--

1399
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,510
100 could be a big number.

1400
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:16,250
I'm going to guess
them one by one.

1401
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,190
I'm going to guess them.

1402
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,340
And every time I
guess a node, I'm

1403
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,680
going to prove it's reachable
by guessing the path that

1404
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,760
shows it's reachable.

1405
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,520
So I'm going to guess 100 nodes,
prove that they're reachable,

1406
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,280
and then see, was t of
those reachable nodes?

1407
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,930

1408
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:38,210
If it was, well, then
I would have found it,

1409
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,360
and I would know to say yes.

1410
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,120
But if t was not one
of the 100 reachable

1411
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,370
nodes, and I know
there's only 100--

1412
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:48,040
so if t is not one
of those nodes--

1413
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:53,010
in other words, if I found them
all, and t wasn't one of them,

1414
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:56,020
then I know it's not reachable.

1415
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,400
And that's how,
using the count, I

1416
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,820
can be sure that certain
nodes are not reachable,

1417
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,210
because I just find all the ones
that are, prove that they are,

1418
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,180
check that the count agrees
with what I was given,

1419
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,910
and then say no, t
is not reachable,

1420
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,460
if it's not one of
those nodes that I've

1421
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:20,573
found to be reachable, which
adds up to my given count.

1422
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:21,490
That's the whole idea.

1423
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,040

1424
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,410
Of course, how do
you get the count?

1425
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:30,340
Oddly enough, it's
kind of the same idea

1426
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,110
repeated over and over again.

1427
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,490
But I guess we'll have
to do that next time.

1428
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,860
So let's just write this down.

1429
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,290
And we'll kind of use
it as the beginning

1430
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,140
of Thursday's lecture.

1431
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,690
So we're going to go through
each node u, one by one.

1432
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,420

1433
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,330
Now we're going to
guess, for each node,

1434
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,040
whether there's a
path to it or not.

1435
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,900
So I'm going to call
it either p or n.

1436
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,390
Again, this is now--
think about my 100 nodes.

1437
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,795
I'm going to be
guessing all 100 nodes.

1438
01:15:00,795 --> 01:15:02,170
I'm going to
nondeterministically

1439
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:06,890
pick a path from that node
that I guess is reachable.

1440
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:10,510
So if I guess a node,
there is a path.

1441
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,650
I'm going to confirm there's
a path by nondeterministically

1442
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,340
picking it.

1443
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,140
If I don't find
that path, I just

1444
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:21,520
reject punt on that branch.

1445
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,960
If that path that
I found actually

1446
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,380
led me to t, so u, that
node that I'm working on,

1447
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,400
is currently t, then
I know to accept.

1448
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,180
But otherwise, I'm just going
to count the number of nodes

1449
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,210
that I find are reachable.

1450
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,070
If I've guessed that
u is not reachable,

1451
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,540
I'm just going to skip it.

1452
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,640
At the end, I see
whether the number

1453
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,530
of nodes that I
have determined are

1454
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:53,790
reachable agrees with
my original count, c.

1455
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,470
So does k equal c or not?

1456
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,440
If it doesn't equal,
they're not equal,

1457
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,470
then I didn't find all
the reachable nodes.

1458
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,000
I didn't guess right.

1459
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,130
And so I punt.

1460
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,010
I say, well, bad branch
of the nondeterminism.

1461
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:10,130
I just give up.

1462
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,590
But some branch of
the nondeterminism

1463
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,740
is going to guess all of
the correct nodes which

1464
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,010
are reachable.

1465
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:22,810
And then, if t hadn't been
found already to be one of them,

1466
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,250
at this point, I know
t is not reachable.

1467
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:28,150
And so I can output no.

1468
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,370
OK?

1469
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:34,600
So that's the whole thing.

1470
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,733
What is m? m is the-- yeah,
good question. m is the number

1471
01:16:37,733 --> 01:16:38,650
of nodes of the graph.

1472
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,650
I should have said that.

1473
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:43,200
So you don't want to go-- you
don't want to get into a loop.

1474
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,710
So you better cut off
your picking of a path

1475
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:49,520
to some cutoff value.

1476
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,790
So you're going to
cut it off at m,

1477
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,320
which is the number
of nodes, which

1478
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,970
is going to be long enough.

1479
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,750
Actually, we're going to play
with that in a bit later, but--

1480
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,108

1481
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:03,900
OK, let's just see.

1482
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,330
How do I know I did not
visit the same node twice

1483
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,423
when counting?

1484
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:09,090
Because I'm just going
to go through all

1485
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,730
of the nodes in some order.

1486
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,810
Pick any order.

1487
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:18,430
The nodes appear in some
order in the representation

1488
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:21,780
of the graph on the input.

1489
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,620
So any old order--

1490
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,620
I'm just going to go
through the nodes in order.

1491
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:31,180
Therefore, I'm never going
to see the same node twice.

1492
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,710
What does step 4 mean?

1493
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:41,010

1494
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:46,150
So step 4 is--

1495
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,730
step 4 means, for each
node, I'm guessing

1496
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:52,120
that that node either
has a path to it from s

1497
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,040
or does not have a
path to it from s.

1498
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,200

1499
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,700
So kind of thinking about
it, the original-- we're

1500
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,200
out of time.

1501
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,820
So why don't I--

1502
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,260
I'm happy to discuss
this in the office hours.

1503
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,360
I'm just going to skip
over the rest of the slides

1504
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,770
here and review.

1505
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,970
We have a missing check-in.

1506
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:18,980

1507
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,220
Let's just-- I want to
make sure everybody's

1508
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,620
got all their check-ins here.

1509
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,500
So why don't we just--

1510
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:34,460
if we know NL is equal
to coNL, we also-- we

1511
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,730
showed 2SAT complement
is NL complete.

1512
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:40,850
It also then follows that
2SAT itself is NL complete,

1513
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,418
because NL equals coNL.

1514
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:44,210
So I'm going to give
you the answer to this

1515
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:50,373
just, because I want you
all to finish this poll.

1516
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:52,040
Still, some of you
are getting it wrong.

1517
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,130

1518
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,800
OK.

1519
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,600
So please answer it quick.

1520
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,870
And then we're going to end.

1521
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,460
Are we all done?

1522
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,980
Get your participation
points here.

1523
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:08,595
Three seconds.

1524
01:19:08,595 --> 01:19:11,770

1525
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,480
OK, ending.

1526
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,520
OK, doesn't matter.

1527
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,640
So here, we ran over.

1528
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,110
Sorry about that.

1529
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,460
Quick review.

1530
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,960
This is what we
didn't quite finish.

1531
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,830
This is part 5.

1532
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,670
But we'll finish that next time.

1533
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:29,570
OK, when showing
PATH is NL complete,

1534
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:32,380
we also need to list the nodes
for constructing the graph.

1535
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,430
The slides only mention--

1536
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:34,870
yeah, I kind of skipped that.

1537
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,773
But yeah, you can just
write down all the nodes.

1538
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,940
Again, but that's also going
to just take log space,

1539
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,073
as you observed.

1540
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:43,240
Yeah, technically, when
you're writing down a graph,

1541
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,440
you write down a
list of the nodes,

1542
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,065
and you write down
a list of the edges.

1543
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:48,160
I kind of skipped
writing down the nodes.

1544
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,050
But yeah, it's the same--

1545
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,335
doesn't matter.

1546
01:19:51,335 --> 01:19:52,960
So I'm going to say
