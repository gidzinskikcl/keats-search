Showed that natural numbers and real numbers are not the same size to introduce the diagonalization method and used it to prove acceptance problem for TMs is undecidable. Introduced the reducibility method to show that HALT for TMs is undecidable.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
