Discussed a connection between games and quantifiers. Described the formula game and showed that generalized geography is PSPACE-complete.  Introduced log space:  L and NL. Defined the configuration graph to prove NL is a subset of P.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
