    "answer": "So let's turn here, to trying to get an intuitive feeling for P and NP. And we'll return now to this notion of NP corresponding to easy verifiability. NP are the languages where you can easily verify membership quickly. I'll try to explain what that means. In contrast, P are the languages where you can test membership quickly. By quickly, I'm using polynomial time. That's going to be, for us, that's what quickly means in this course. In the case of the Hamiltonian path problem, the way you verify the membership is you give the path. In the case of the composites, the way you verify the membership is you give the factor. In those two cases, and in general, when we have a problem that's in NP, we think of this verification as having-- we give it a special name, called a certificate, or sometimes a short certificate, to emphasize the polynomiality of the certificate. It's like a way of proving that you're a member of the language. In the case of COMPOSITES, the proof is the factor. In the case of HAMPATH, the proof is the path, the Hamiltonian path. Contrast that, for example, if you had a prime number. Proving a number is composite is easy because you just exhibit the factor. How would you prove that a number is prime? What's the short certificate of proving that some number has no factor? That's not so obvious. In fact, there are ways of doing it, which I'm not going to get into in the case of testing of numbers prime. And now it's even known to be in P, so that's even better. But there's no obvious way of proving that a number is prime with a short certificate. This concept of being able to verify when you are a member of the language, that's key to understanding NP. That's the intuition you need to develop and hopefully take away from today's lecture, or at least",

    "answer": "4 simple values, 0, 1, 2, 3. The y values are the same as x values. So this is 0,0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 3. They're all lying on a line. But I'm going to fit. I'm going to plot them out. And then I'm going to fit a quadratic. y if it equals ax squared plus bx plus c to this. Now I know it's a line, but I want to see what happens if I fit a quadratic. So I'm going to use polyfit to fit my quadratic. I'm going to print out some data about it. And then I'm going to use Polyval to estimate what those values should be. Plot them out. And then compute r squared value, and see what happens. All right, OK, and let me set this up better. What am I doing? I want to just fit it to a line. I know it's a line, but I'm going to fit a quadratic to it. And what I'd expect is, even though there's an extra term there, it shouldn't matter. So if I go to Python, and I run this, I run exactly that example, look at that. a equals 0, b is 1, c equals 0. Look at the r-squared value. I'll pull that together for you. It says, in this perfect case, there's what I get. The blue line is drawn through the actual values. The dotted red line is drawn through the predicted values. They exactly line up. And in fact, the solution implied says, the higher order term coefficient 0, it doesn't matter. So what it found was y equals x. I know you're totally impressed I could find a straight line. But notice what happened there. I dropped or that system said, you don't need the higher order term. Wonderful r-squared value. OK, let's see how well it predicts. Let's add in one more point, out at 20. So this is 0, 1, 2, 3. That's 0, 1, 2, 3. I'm going to add 20 in there, so it's 0, 0 , 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 20, 20. Again, I can estimate using the same model. So I'm not recomputing the model, the model I predicted from using those first set of four points. I can get the estimated y values, plot those out, and you again, compute the r-squared value here. And even adding that point in, there's the line. And guess what. Perfectly predicts it. No big surprise. So it says, in the case of perfect data, adding the higher order terms isn't going to cause a problem. The system will say coefficients are 0. That's all I need. All right, now, let's go back and add in just a tiny bit of noise right there. 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3, 3.1. So I've got a slight deviation in the y value there. Again, I can plot them. I'm going to fit a quadratic to them. I'm going to print out some information about it and then get the estimated values using that new model to see what it should look like. I'm not going to run it. I'm going to show you the result.",

    "question": "What does the space hierarchy theorem state about space-bound functions?",
    "answer": "space hierarchy theorem so here is the statement of the theorem and it says for any bound think of s is going to be some you know space bound and again f has to satisfy some technical condition in yellow remember that it's yellow because that's going to be relevant later um uh so there's going to be some technical condition um for no matter what function you you have whatever space bound you have as long as it satisfies this condition which is a mild condition but you need it uh whatever space bound you have um you can find a language a which requires exactly that much space so if f is like n cubed we're going to find a language a that requires n cubed space if it's n to the hundredth we can find the language that requires into the 100th space and cannot be done within 1999 space whatever it is you can find a language that requires exactly that much space and if you like it a little bit more formally so that means that it can be decided in that much space but it cannot be decided in less space okay framing it in a slightly different way in terms of our space classes um i'm going to define a notion which is you know kind of it's not it's not said this way in the book but maybe it's a helpful way to write it down it's space little o of f of n so those are all the things that you can do by a function that's little o of f of n in space so space little o of f n is properly contained within space f of n in other words there's something here which is not in there okay picture pictorially i'm going to exhibit some language some explicit language a which i can do in this much space but not in any less now you know you can sort of think of this as a little bit like the situation for context-free languages and regular languages where we exhibited a particular language that differentiated that was it context-free but not regular and we're going to kind of do the same thing now but the one key difference is that in the case of separating the context free and the regular we could give a nice language like 0 to the k1 to the k here the language is not going to be so nice to describe it's going to be the language that some turing machine we're going to give decides but you're not going to be able to get a nice simple understanding of a it's going to be whatever that turing machine does and so in that sense it's not a very natural language um that's easy to sort of get your mind around um so the i outline and really you don't have to worry about this but maybe it helps it's really going to be a kind of a diagonalization proof um the way this machine d um is going to operate so d is going to give you my language a um so d is going to be designed and i'm going to show you d on the next slide uh d is going to run within my target space bound f of n and here's the key here's the kicker d is going to be designed to make sure that its language cannot be done in less space and the way it does that is it makes sure that its language is different from any language that that is um decidable by a turing machine in in less space and it's going to be different in at least one place so any d is going to guarantee that its language cannot be done in little o of f of n space because it's going to be different from every language that's doable in little o of f of n space somewhere okay that's the point and then the language a is going to be the language of this uh turing machine d okay so it looks like a tall order the d has to make sure that each you know that that for every machine its language differs uh from that machine's language if that machine is running in little of f event space but it's basically going to be a diagonalization so for all of the different possible inputs to d that input is going to actually code up a machine uh on which we're going to make sure that we're different from that machine if it's a small space machine okay let's see so i can take a couple of questions here does f have to be computable so that's going to be one of the conditions um that we're going to have to guarantee where f satisfies the technical condition yeah it's going to end up being half it's going to be computable but that's not enough um good question though uh okay so let's let's let's move on from there okay now so here is now what's what my job is to give you this turing machine d so d these language is going to be my my language a which i can which requires f of n space cannot be done unless okay oops i need to i need the full slide here so i have to take myself out um [Music] all right uh now this is my goal i want to exhibit this language a which i can do in this much space but not in any less and so i'm going to give this machine d as i mentioned where a is d's language d runs in order f event space and that sort of that achieves this part and d it makes sure that its language cannot be done in any less space so that achieves this part so it's different from the language of any machine that runs in little o event f of n space okay um [Music] so uh this is how d is gonna work okay i'm gonna try to give you a little picture uh to help help see the to accompany the description uh so d gets its input w which is of length n the very first thing d does is it marks off f of n's space because it's only allowed to use we're only going to allow d to use f of n space because otherwise we're in danger of d not of a not being in in space f of n so d is going to guarantee that by making sure it's going to mark off f of n space and if it ever tries to use more than that it just rejects and but by virtue of that we're sure that these language is in space f of n because d is an f of n space turing machine and it's going to be the side okay so this part so far is not too hard okay now we're going to start getting into the meat here so if w um now what we want to think of w as a description of a machine that we're going to feed that's that's going to run on w so this is going to a little bit you know back to an earlier when we talked about diagonalization so don't get thrown off by this um we if we're going to think of w not only as the input to d but it's also going to be the description of a machine and if it turns out that w is doesn't describe anything it's just a jump w then we're not not interested we're gonna we're just gonna reject on that w we're only interested in the w's that do describe some machine m okay so if m if w uh describes some machine m then we're gonna run m on w and we're going to do the do the opposite of what uh what m does that's the whole idea we're just going to uh make sure that what we're doing is not the same as what emma's doing so at a high level the the basic idea for this is is not hard um so we're going to simulate m on w if m x rejects then we'll accept and if m accepts then we'll reject we're just going to do the opposite um and i think that is so we have to be careful when we do the simulation this is a little bit of a detail but you know this is a proof where you need to pay attention to some details um the cost of simulating m on d is only a constant factor um because if m uses a certain amount of space when d is simulating m you know m may have a larger tape alphabet than d does but these can then encode um m's tape by using several cells for each of m's cells but it's only going to be a constant factor and that's important here because um we have to make sure that you know if this was a big blow up um d would not be able to run m um i i think i'm sort of arguing the details without making sure we understand the fundamental concept um so let me back up the point is that d is doing something the opposite of m now uh d can't be different from every m because d itself is a turing machine of course but but the thing is is that d is only running within f of n tape cells so it has to be able to do that simulation of m within that amount of tape if m is using a lot of tape then d is going to use a lot of tape and it's just going to reject so this is only going to really come into play getting being able to simulate m if m is using a small amount of using a small amount of space so that d can do the simulation okay so let's just see maybe uh so they're going to be some issues here but before i get to that let's just see what uh what your questions are how can a turing machine know if w is encoding some other turing machine no that's simple you know what what is a coding of a turing machine it's just you know the standard we have a standard coding um it's just you know coding the rules of the machine so it has to have states transition function blah blah blah so it just has to be some you know whatever our encoding for the turing machine is we can always test whether a string is a legitimate encoding of a turing machine so that that shouldn't be bad um somebody says why do we reject if we use more than f n cells isn't it okay to use order f of n yes it could be but we have to cut it off somewhere you know it might be it's okay we could use two f of n we could use 10 f of n but we have to have some constant for d and let's just kind of simply constant one so d has to run within f of n cells um and that's going to guaran that's going to be good enough for us okay do we have to make sure that m runs a little of f of n so we can't really tell whether m is running in little o of f of n or we can tell us whether we can finish the simulation so that's actually going to be maybe you can just hold off on that question because there is a point that we have to follow up on in that which is um uh just because you know we may or may not be able to finish simulating m on this w doesn't necessarily tell us what the asymptotic behavior of m is but we'll have to look at that in a bit okay so somebody's saying what happens if m loops on w that's going to be one of our issues we have to deal with that's a good question there step two alone can use them more than f of n cells yeah step two alone can use more than f of n cells if it does we're just going to end up projecting okay so we're getting good questions here some of them we're going to which i'm going to address anyway so why don't we just move on um okay so here is sort of a question i think this is one of the questions that that related to one of the ones that got asked what happens if it runs in little of f of n space so we we remember what we're trying to do is be different from every small space you know little o of f of n space machine so what if m runs a little o of f of n space but has a big constant so what i mean by that concretely is suppose d is an n cubed space so suppose we're trying to get a in in cubed space but show what's not in n squared space d is going to run an n cubed and what and we have to make sure that any machine that's running in n squared space cannot do the same language um so we're going to be different from that but the problem is that uh in uh the machine m might be running in n squared space but with a huge constant so it might be running in a million n squared so that's still a machine that's running in a little o of n cubed and we have to be different from it but for the particular w we're working on we might not have enough space to run m because of the huge constant it that con the asymptotic behavior is only going to be relevant well for large w for smaller b we may not see that we may not have enough space to run m so um what are we going to do to fix that we're going to run that m on infinitely many different w so it's going to be infinitely many different w's that are all going to encode the same m and the way i'm going to do that is by uh thinking of w as representing m but having an unbounded number of trailing zeros after that so i'm going to strip off the very first thing i'm going to do with w is i'm going to strip off the trailing zeros up into the final one i'm going to remove those and then take the rest and as the description of the machine so now i'm going to have potentially w's that have an enormous number of zeros at the end big enough so that i can see the asymptotic behavior of m and that if m is really running in little o of f of n space i'll have enough space to run m to completion on w and so then i'll be able to be different from it okay um so i'm kind of showing that over here so here's a very large w i'm going to strip off the trailing zeros the rest of it is just going to be m and i'm going to run this m on the whole w the entire w without the zero stripped off so now m is going to be running on a very large input um big enough so that d uh d which has asymptotically more space than m does will have enough space to run empty completion um now another question that got asked what happens if m loops that's going to be a problem because d always has to hold and if it just blindly simulates m then d might be looping on m none of m is going to use a lot of space by the way because then d is going to catch it in step one but if m uses his loops on a small amount of space then uh d might end up looping as presently constructed so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put a counter which makes it stop if it runs for 2 to the f of n space so basically because that's how long d could possibly run without looping anyway m could be running without looping anyway and so we're going to run it for this amount of this number of steps and uh i'm going to reject if it hasn't yet halted as well as uh that because it has to be looping at that point anyway um and so it's not interesting for us it doesn't matter what we're going to do",

    "answer": "I want to print out what an edge looks like, I'm going to ask that it print out the name of the source, and then an arrow, and then the name of the destination. So notice what I do there. Given an instance of an edge, I can print it. And it will get the source or the node associated with source inside this instance, get for that the getName method, and then call it. Notice the open-close paren there to actually call it. What does that do? It says, inside the edge I've got something that points to a node. I get that node. I take the method associated with it. And I call it. That returns the string. And then I glue that together with the arrow. I do the same thing on the destination. And I just print it out. Pretty straightforward, hopefully. OK, now I have to make a decision about the graph. I'm going to start with digraphs, directed graphs. And I need to think about how I might represent the graph. I can create nodes. I can create edges, but I've got to bring them all together. So I'll remind you, a digraph is a directed graph. The edges pass in only one direction. And here's one way I could do it. Given all the sources and all the destinations, I could just create a big matrix called an adjacency matrix. The rows would be all the sources. The columns would be all the destinations. And then in a particular spot in the matrix, if there is an edge between a source and a destination, I'd just put a one. Otherwise I'd put a zero. Note, by the way, because it's a directed graph, it's not symmetric. There might be a one between S and D, but not between D and S, unless there are edges both ways. This would be a perfectly reasonable way to represent a graph, but not the most convenient one. I'd have to go into the matrix to look things up. It may also not be a very efficient way of representing things. For example, if there are very few edges in the graph, I could have a huge matrix with mostly zeros. And that's not the most effective way to do it. So I'm going to use an alternative called an adjacency list. And the idea here is, for every node in the graph. I'm going to associate with it a list of destinations. That is, for a node, what are the places I can reach with a single edge? OK, so let's see what that does if we want to build it. And yes, there's a lot of code here, but it's pretty easy to look through I hope. Here's the choice I'm going to make. Again, what's a graph? It's a set of nodes. It's a set of edges. I'm going to have a way of putting nodes into the graph. And I'm going to choose to, when I put a node into the graph, to store it as a key in a dictionary. OK? When I initialize the graph, I'm just going to set this internal variable, edges, to be an empty dictionary. And the second part of it is, when I add an edge to the graph between two nodes from a source to a destination, I'm going to take that point in the dictionary associated with the source. It's a key. And associated with it, I'm going to just have a list of the nodes I can reach from edges from that source. So notice what happens here. If I want to add a node, remember, it's a node not an edge-- I'll first check to make sure that it's not already in the dictionary. That little loop is basic, or that if is saying, if it's in this set of keys, it will return true. And I'm going to complain. I'm trying to copy a node or duplicate a node. Otherwise, notice what I do. When I put a node into the dictionary, I go into that dictionary, edges. I create an entry with the key that is the node. And the value I put in there is initially an empty list. I'm going to say one more piece carefully. It's a node not a name. And that's OK in Python. It is literally the key is the node itself. It's an object, which is what I'd like. All right, what if I want to add an edge? Well, an edge is going to go from a source to a destination node. So, I'm going to get out from the edge the source piece. I'm going to get out from the edge the destination piece by calling those methods. Again, notice the open-close paren, which takes the method and actually calls it. Because remember, an edge was an object itself. Given those, I'll check to make sure that they are both in the dictionary. That is, I've already added them to the graph. I can't make a connection between things that aren't in the graph.

    "question": "How does memoization change the time complexity of computing Fibonacci numbers?",
    "answer": "talking about the word ram model of computation. A question here that usually doesn't matter in this class. Usually we assume additions take constant time. And we usually do that because it's usually true. And in general, our model is the w bit additions-- where w is our machine word size-- takes constant time. But for this problem and this problem only, pretty much, for Fibonacci numbers, I happen to know that the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. So to write them down actually requires theta n bits because they are some constant to the n power. And so they're actually really big . n is probably bigger than w. Usually you think of problems that are much bigger than 64 or whatever your word size happens to be. We do assume that w is at least log n. But n is probably bigger than w. It might be bigger or smaller. We don't know. And in general, to do an n bit addition-- these are n bit additions-- is going to take ceiling of n over w time. So in the end, we will spend this times n, because we have to do that, many of them, which is n plus n squared over w time. So a bit of a weird running time. But it's polynomial, whereas this original recursive algorithm was exponential here. Using this one simple idea of just remembering the work we've done, suddenly this exponential time algorithm becomes polynomial. Why? Because we have few sub problems. We had n sub problems. And for each sub problem, we could write a recurrence relation that if we already knew the solutions to smaller sub problems, we could compute this bigger problem very efficiently. This happened to be constant time or constant additions. n over w time. But as long as this is polynomial and this is polynomial, we're happy, because we have this nice formula that the time it takes is, at most, the sum over all sub problems of the relation time. So I'm referring to sub problems, like a number of them and the time it takes to evaluate this, ignoring the recursive calls. That's important. This is the non recursive part. In the notes, I call this non-recursive work. So this formula gives us a way to bound the running time of one of these algorithms if we use memoization. Without memoization, this is not true, Fibonacci to exponential time. But if we add memoization, we know that we only solve each sub-problem once. And so we just need to see, for each one, how much did it cost me to compute it, assuming all the recursion work is free, because that's already taken into account by the summation. So in particular, this summation is at most the number of sub-problems times the time per sub-problem,",

    "question": "How does memoization change the time complexity of computing Fibonacci numbers?",
    "answer": "Let's get to another problem that does not fit recursion so well. But we can make it better. So this is-- we're going to start with a very simple problem, which is computing Fibonacci numbers. It's really just a toy problem to illustrate a very powerful idea, which is memoization. So the problem I'm interested in is I'm given a particular number, n. And I want to compute the nth Fibonacci number. And in case you forgot, the nth Fibonacci number is given by this recurrence. fn is fn minus 1 plus fn minus 2 with base case, let's say, f1 equals f2 equals 1. And so we'd like to compute this. This seems-- this is a recurrence. So it seems very natural to write it as a recursive algorithm. So let's try to do it. We start with what are the sub problems. The obvious sub problems are just the various Fibonacci numbers, f i for i between 1 and n. So there are n of these sub problems. Cool. Let's see. We want a relation between them. Well, maybe just to distinguish the problems from the Fibonacci numbers, let me write f of i. This is a function, an algorithm we're going to define. And it's defined to be-- the goal we're trying to get is the ith Fibonacci number given i. And then we can write the recurrence relation on these guys, just f of i equals f of i minus 1 plus f of i minus 2. So in other words, recursively compute those Fibonacci numbers then add them together. That's an algorithm. Next is t for topological order. Here, of course, we just want to compute these in order of increasing i from the base case is up. Another way I like to write this is as a for loop for i equals 1 to n. We will see why. But this gives an explicit order to compute these sub problems. And base case is just the same as the Fibonacci numbers, but I guess I should write in parentheses. The original problem we want to solve is f of n. And the time-- all right, here's where things get interesting or bad. So what is the running time of this recursive algorithm? As I've stated it so far, the running time is given by a recurrence. Let's write the recurrence. So in order to compute f of n, I recursively compute f of i minus 1 or f of n minus 1 here. And I recursively compute f of n minus 2. So that will take t of n minus 2. This first step will take t of n minus 1. And now I need to solve this recurrence. This is not a recurrence that falls to the master method. It doesn't have a divided by. So we have to think about it a little bit. But we don't have to think about it too hard, because this recurrence is the same as this recurrence, which is the same as this recurrence. I've written it three times now. And so the solution to this is the nth Fibonacci number. Oh, sorry. It's a little bit worse because in addition to those recursions, I also spend constant time to do the addition, maybe more than constant time. But if we just count the number of additions we do, it will be plus 1 additions. OK. But this is bigger than the nth Fibonacci number. And if you know anything about Fibonacci numbers, they grow exponentially. They're about golden ratio to the end. I'm wearing golden ratio, in case you forgot the number. So that's bad, because golden ratio is bigger than 1. So this is exponential growth, as we know, especially in this time, exponential growth is bad. In algorithms, exponential growth is bad, because we can only solve very small problems with exponential growth. Very small n. So this is a terrible way to compute the nth Fibonacci number--",

    "question": "What is one of the conditions of the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages (CFLs) concerning the substring x of a string s?",
    "answer": "free and regular, why do we know that's still context free? Because the pushdown automaton for A can be simulating the finite automaton for B inside its finite control, inside its finite memory. The problem is, if you have two context-free languages, you have two pushdown automata, you can't simulate that with one pushdown automaton, because it has only a single stack. So if you're trying to take the intersection of two context-free languages with only a single stack, you're going to be in trouble, because it's hard to-- anyway, that's not a proof, but at least it shows you what goes wrong if you try to do the obvious thing. OK, so if-- and just, here is an important point that was trying to make before. If A and B are both context free and you're taking the intersection, the result may not necessarily be a context-free language. So the class of context-free languages is not closed under its intersection. We'll comment on that in a bit. The context-free languages are closed under the regular operations, however, union, intersection-- union, concatenation, and star. So you should feel comfortable that you know how to prove that. Again, it's one of the-- I think it's problem 0.2. And I think the solution is even given in the book for it. So you just should know how to prove that. It's pretty straightforward. OK, so let's move on then to basically conclude our work on context-free languages, to understand the limitations of context-free grammars, and what kinds of languages may not be context free. And how do you prove that? So how do you prove that, for some language, there is no grammar? Again, you know, it's not enough just to, say, give an informal comment that, I couldn't think of a grammar, or some-- things of that kind. That's not going to be good enough. We need to have a proof. So if we take the language here, 0 to the k, 1 to the k, 2 to the k, so those are strings which are runs of 0's followed by an equal number of 1's followed by an equal number of 2's, so just 0's, then 1's, then 2's, all the same length. That's a language which is not going to be a context-free language. And we'll give a method for proving that. If you had a stack, you can match the 1's with the 0's, but then once you're done with that, the stack is empty. And how do you now make sure that the number of 2's corresponds to the number of 1's that you had? So again, that's an informal argument that's not good enough to be a proof, but it sort of gives an intuition. So we're going to give a method for proving non-context-free-- languages are not context free using, again, a pumping lemma. But this is going to be a pumping lemma that applies to context-free language, not to regular languages. It looks very similar, but it has some extra wrinkles thrown in, because the other older pumping lemma was specific to the regular languages. And this is going to be something that applies to the context-free languages. OK, so now let's just read it. And then we'll try to interpret it again. It's very similar in spirit. Basically, it says that, whenever you have a context-free language, all long strings in the language can be pumped in some kind of way. So it's going to be a little different kind of pumping than we had before. And you stay in the language. OK, so before, we broke the string into three pieces where we could repeat that centerpiece as many times as you like. And you stay in the language. Here, we're going to end up breaking the string into five pieces. So s is going to be broken up into uvxyz. And the way it's going to work here-- so here is a picture. So all long strings-- again, there is going to be a threshold. So whenever you have a language, there is going to be some cut-off length. So all the longer strings in that language can be pumped. And you stay in the language. But the shorter strings, there is no guarantee. So if you have a long string in the language of length at least this pumping length p, then you can break it up into five pieces. But now it's that second and fourth string that are going to play that special pumping role, which means that, what you can do is you can repeat those and you stay in the language. And it's important that you repeat them both, that v and that y, the same number of times. So you're going to have a picture that looks something like this. And that is going to you repeat. If you repeat the v and you repeat the y, you get uvvxyyz. Or if you look at over here, it would be uv squared xy squared z. And that's going to still be in the language. And then we have-- so that's one condition. We'll have to look at all of these conditions when we do the proof, but we just want to understand what the statement is right now. So the second condition is that v and y together cannot be empty. And really, that's another way of saying, they can't both be the empty string, because if they were both the empty string, then repeating them wouldn't change s. And then of course it would stay in the language. So it would be kind of meaningless if they were allowed to be empty. And the last thing is, again, going to be there as a matter of convenience for proving languages are not context free, because you have to make sure there is no possible way of cutting up the string. When you're trying to prove a language is not context free, you have to show the pumping fails. It's going to be helpful sometimes to limit the ways in which the string can be cut up, because then you have-- it's an easier job for you to work with it. So here, it's a little different than before, but sort of similar, that vxy combine as a substring. So I show that over here. vxy together is not too long. So the vxy-- maybe it's better seen up here-- is going to be, at most, p. We'll do an example in a minute of using this. OK, so again, here is our pumping lemma. I've just restated it. So we have it in front of us. And we're going to do a proof. I'm just going to give you the idea of the proof first. And then we'll go through some of the details.",

    "question": "What is one of the conditions of the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages (CFLs) concerning the substring x of a string s?",
    "answer": "which is the introduction to computer graphics course. In fact, my background was working in an animation studio for a little bit of time, and got one movie credit out of it until they changed the standards for movie credits, and then that stopped happening. But in any event, if you watch-- what's that movie-- Up, with the old man. If you hit pause at just the right moment, you can find me right above the list of babies that were born during production. But in any event-- although computer graphics might not sound like an algorithmic discipline, I'll try to convince you guys that, in some sense, you could take just about anybody in our department, have them teach 6.006, and give a similar talk that, like, the material that you've encountered in this course is going to be relevant to your life. The other course that I teach that might be of interest-- and actually, is a little more theoretically flavored-- that I teach is 6.838. So since Erik so kindly put my name on the board here, I guess I can draw The So the main object of interest in 6.838 is a particular thing called the simplicial complex. Usually, in 6.006, we spend a lot of time thinking about graphs. Let me draw you a graph. So I'm going to take a square and subdivide it. And now, let's say I put edges diagonally like that. Now, in 6.006, this thing is just a bunch of nodes connected by edges. In fact, if I took this edge and I moved it down or something, it would be the same graph. But of course, in a lot of computer graphics applications, this thing also looks an awful lot like a square. And the reason is that, of course, the graph here contains triangles inside of it. And so for instance, maybe I think of my graph as a collection of vertices, a collection of edges. This is the sort of notation we've seen before. And then I add a third thing to my description, which is a set of triplets. That's a set of triangles here. And we can take a lot of the algorithms that we've talked about in this class and extend it to this case. For example, here's a deceptively annoying one. Let's say that I want the shortest path between two vertices of my graph. We certainly have learned Dijkstra's algorithm. That's one technique to do that. And indeed, common practice in computer graphics, which is shameful, is on your triangle mesh, if you want the shortest path between two vertices, run Dijkstra's algorithm on the edges. And let's see if that works really quick. Let's say that I want the shortest path between-- and, by the way, I'm going to assume the length of my edges are the lengths as I've drawn them on the board here. So it's like 1, 1, square root of 2. OK. So let's say I want the shortest path between the bottom left and the upper right. If I run Dijkstra's algorithm, we're in good shape, right? We get-- I'll let you do the computations at home. You'll get the path that is these two edges. But here's a really annoying thing. Let's say, instead, I wanted the shortest path from the upper left to the lower right. If I run Dijkstra's algorithm on this triangulated square, what's going to be the shortest path? Yeah. In fact, there's a bunch of them. One of them might go all the way down, and then all the way to the right. What's the length of this path? 1, 2, 3, 4. Is that the length of the shortest path? Well, probably not. Well, we would like our shortest path to do something like that. But graphs don't know how to talk to triangles. And this is going to be a problem. In fact, it wasn't until fairly recently [INAUDIBLE] history terms that we were able to kind of work out the correct algorithm for the shortest path in a triangulated domain like this. And that's the runtime that we would expect. This is called MMP. I'm guessing Erik and Jason could do a better job describing it than I can. But the basic idea of the MMP algorithm actually is a really-- happens to be a nice extension of the way that we taught Dijkstra's algorithm in 6.006, because they really do keep track of these level sets of the distance function. But now, the level sets have to-- oops-- have to window and edge like that when I compute shortest path, which is a giant headache. This is one of these algorithms that was known in theory about 10 years before anybody bothered to implement it in a way that they could convince themselves it ran in n log n time. And nowadays, there's a cottage industry in computer graphics research papers to implement this and then speed it up in different ways. And sadly, the reality is that a different algorithm that we cover in 6.838 called fast marching-- which doesn't actually give you the shortest path, but some approximation thereof-- is faster, easier to use, and basically indistinguishable. In any event, in 6.838, we kind of have an interesting dual-mindset. We'll talk about a lot of algorithms that look like what we've done in whatever this class is-- 6.006. But at the same time, start to have a more geometric flavor, and we don't worry quite as much about [INAUDIBLE].. So in our computation model, oftentimes, we're kind of OK with real numbers, because that's not where the headache is. And of course, when you write code in this class, you use double-precision floating-point. If you're more responsible, like in Jason's previous lecture, you should probably keep track of the number of operations to make sure that your error is counted. But I'm not sure that we really bother with that. In any event, this allows us to have two different mindsets. There's one mindset, which is discrete. There's another mindset, which is smooth. We think about understanding geometry, like these triangular domains, as an approximation of a smooth surface. And then we might want to do stuff like compute curvature and so on, which is really associated with computing derivatives, which of course, we'll have on these kinds of simplicial objects. And that leads to this really fun area of math and computer science, whatever, called discrete differential geometry, which sounds like a contradiction in terms. And it's something that we covered in quite some detail in this course. So we build up, all of calculus, that the only calculations you're left to do are on the vertices and edges and triangles of a triangle mesh. And get pretty far, including some constructions of topology, like the Duran complex, and so on. I would argue, actually, if you take our course and then the differential geometry courses in that department, somehow, some of the indices and headaches that you often encounter in that world are much more concrete when you try to make them work on a mesh. In any event, I think I've already spent all of my time.",

    "answer": "[CLICKING] [RUSTLING] [SQUEAKING] [CLICKING] MICHAEL SIPSER: OK. Hi, everybody. Let's get started. So, it's been a while since we came together in a lecture. Last week, we had the holiday. We had the midterm. So with that, what have we been doing? We finished the first half of the course about two weeks ago, where we talked about-- we were talking about computability theory. We have shifted into the second half, talking about complexity theory. So get your mind back to that. We discussed the various different models and ways of measuring complexity on different models-- at least in terms of the amount of time that's used. And in the end, we settled on the one-tape Turing machine, which is the same model we had been working with in the first half of the course, and argued that though the measures of complexity are going to differ somewhat from model to model, they're not going to differ by more than a polynomial amount. And so, since the kinds of questions we're going to be asking are going to be, basically, whether problems are polynomial or not, it's not going to really matter which model we pick among reasonable deterministic models. And so, the one-tape Turing machine is a reasonable choice. Given that, we defined time complexity classes, the TIME[T(n)] classes. We defined the class P, which was invariant among all of those different deterministic models in the sense that it didn't matter which model we choose, we were going to end up with the same class P. So that argues for its naturalness. And we gave an example of this path problem being in P. And we kind of ended that lecture before the midterm with the discussion of this Hamiltonian path problem. So we're going to come back to that today. So today, we're going to look at non-non-deterministic complexity; define the classes' non-deterministic time or NTIME; talk about the class NP, the P versus NP problem-- which one of the very famous unsolved problems in our field; and look at dynamic programming, one of the most basic algorithm - polynomial-time algorithms and polynomial-time reproducibility - moving toward our discussion of NP completeness, which we will begin next lecture. So with that, let's move into today's content, which is, well, just a quick review. As I mentioned, we defined the time complexity class. The time complexity class is a collection",

    "question": "What arguments are made to support using a one-tape Turing machine as a model for defining time complexity classes?",
    "answer": "Now let's look at what the transition function, how that operates. So the transition function, remember, tells how the machine is actually doing its computation. And it says that, if you're in a certain state and the head is looking at a certain tape symbol, then you can go to a new state. You write a new symbol at that location on the tape. And you can move the head either left or right. So that's how we get the effect of the head being able to be bi-directional. And here is the writing on the tape. It comes up right here. So just an example here which says that, if we're in state two and the head is looking at an a currently on the tape, then we can move the state r. We change that a to a b. And we move the head right 1 square. Now, this is important. When you give a certain input here to the Turing machine, it may compute around for a while, moving its head back and forth, as we were showing. And it may eventually halt by either entering the q accept state or the q reject state, which I didn't bring out here, but that's important. These are the accepting, rejecting, special states of the machine. Or the machine may never enter one of those. It may just go on, and on, and on and never halt. We call that looping, a little bit of a misnomer, because looping implies some sort of a repetition. For us, looping just means not halting. And so therefore, M has three possible outcomes for each input, this w. It might accept w by entering the accept state. It could reject w by entering the reject state, which means it's going to reject it by halting. Or we also say we can reject by looping. You can reject the string by running forever. That's just the terminology that's common in the subject. So you either accept it by halting and accepting or rejecting it by either halting and rejecting or by just going forever. That's also considered to be rejecting, sort of rejecting in a sense by default. If you never actually have accepted it, then it's going to be rejected. OK, check in three here-- all right, so now our last check in for the day, we say, this Turing machine model is deterministic. I'm just saying that. But if you look at the way we set it up, if you've been following the formal definition so far, you would understand why it's deterministic. So let's just, as a way of checking that, how would we change this definition? Because we will look at the next lecture at non-deterministic Turing machines. So a little bit of a lead in to that, how would we change this definition to make it a non-deterministic Turing machine? Which of those three options would we use? So here, I'll launch that poll. I've got about 10 people left. Let's give them another 10 seconds. OK, I think that's everybody who has answered it from before. So here, I think you pretty much almost all of you got the right idea. It is B, in fact, because when we have the power set symbol here, that means there might be several-- there is a subset of possibilities. So that indicates several different ways to go. And that's the essence of non-determinism. OK, so I think we're-- whoops. All right, so look, this is also kind of setting us up for next lecture and where we're going to be going with this. So these are basically two in a-- well, two or three important definitions here. One is-- we talked about the regular languages from finite automata. We talked about the context-free languages from the grammars and the pushdown automata. What are the languages that the Turing machines can do? Those are called, in this course, anyway, Turing-recognizable languages, or T recognizable. Those are the languages that the Turing machine can recognize. And so just to make sure we were on the same page on this, the language of the machine is the collection of strings that the machine accepts. So the things that are not in the language are the things that are rejected either by looping or by halting and rejecting. So only the ones that are accepted is the language. Every machine has just a single language. It's the language of all strings that that machine accepts. And we'll say that and recognize that language, if that language is the collection of such strings that are accepted. And we will call that language a Turing-recognizable language, if there is some Turing machine that can recognize it. Now, this feature of being able to reject by running forever is a little bit weird, perhaps. And from the standpoint of practicality, it's more convenient if the machine always makes a decision to accept or reject in finite time and doesn't just reject by going forever. And so we're going to bring out a special class of Turing machines that have that feature, that they always halt. The halting states, by the way-- maybe it didn't say this explicitly-- are the q accept and the q reject states. The accept and reject states are the halting states. So if the machine halts, that means it ends up in one of those two. So it has made a decision of accepting or rejecting at the point at which it has halted. So we'll say a machine is a decider if it always halts on every input. So for every w fed in, the machine is eventually going to come to a q accept or a q reject. We call such a machine a decider. And now we're going to say, a language is-- so we'll say that the machine decides a language if it's the language of the machine, so the collection of accepted strings, and the machine is the decider. We'll say that, instead of just recognizing the language, we'll say that it decides the language. And the Turing-decidable language is a language that the machine-- of all strings the machine accepts for some Turing machine which is a decider, which is a Turing machine that always halts. So if a Turing machine may sometimes reject by looping, then it's only recognizing its language. If the Turing machine is always halting, so it's always rejecting by explicitly coming to a reject state and halting, then we'll say it's actually deciding the language. So then, in a sense, that's better. And we're going to distinguish between those two, because they're not the same. There are some languages which can be recognized, but not decided. And so in fact, we're going to get the following picture here, that the Turing-recognizable languages are a proper subset. They include all of-- everything that's decidable, certainly is going to be recognizable, because being a decider is an additional restriction to impose, an additional requirement. So everything that's decidable is going to be automatically recognizable. But there are things which are recognizable which are not decidable, as we'll see. I'll actually give an example of that, but not prove it next lecture. And just for, just to complete out this picture, I'm going to also point out-- we haven't proven this yet, but we will prove it-- that the decidable languages also include all the context-free languages, which, in turn, include the regular languages, as was already seen. So we haven't shown this inclusion yet. But actually, this is the picture that we get. So there is actually a hierarchy of containments here. Regular languages are a subset of the context-free languages, which are, in turn, a subset of the decidable languages, which in turn, are a subset of the Turing-recognizable languages.",

    "answer": "Often, the challenge in applying the pumping lemma in either case that we've seen involves choosing that string that you need to pump, that you're going to pump. So you have to choose s in F, which is longer than p, which s to go with. So you might try this one, first glance. Here is a string that's in the language, because it's two copies of the string 0 to the p1 0 to-- and then 0 to the p1. So that's in the language, but it's a bad choice. Before I get ahead of myself, let's draw a picture of s, which I think is always helpful to see. So here is runs of 0's and then a 1, runs of 0's and then a 1. Why is this a bad choice? Because you can pump that string and you remain in the language. There is a way to cut that string up and you'll stay in the language. And the way to cut it up is to let the x be just that substring which is just the 1. And the v and y can be a couple of 0's or a single 0 on either side of that 1. And now that's going to be a small vxy. But if you repeat v and y, you're going to stay in the language, because you'll just be adding 0's here. You'll be adding same number of 0's there. And then you're going to have a string which still looks like ww. And you'll still be in the language. So that means that cutting it up doesn't get you out of the language under pumping. And the fact is that that's a bad choice for s, because there is that way of cutting it up. So you have to show there's no way-- you don't get to pick the way to cut it up. You have to show that there is no way to cut it up in order to violate the pumping lemma. So if instead you use the string 0 to the p, 1 to the p, 0 to the p, 1 to the p-- so this is 0's followed by 1's followed by 0's followed by 1's, all the same number of them-- that can't be pumped satisfying the three conditions. And just going through that-- now if you try to break it up, you're going to lose. Or the lemma is going to lose. You're going to be happy, but the lemma is not going to be happy, because it's not going-- it's going to violate the condition. Condition three says vxy is not-- doesn't span too much, and in fact, can't span two runs of 0's or two runs of 1's. It's just not big enough, because they're more than p things-- they're p things apart. And this one string, this string vxy is only p long. And so therefore, if you repeat v and y, you're going to have two runs of 0's or two 1's that have unequal length. And now that's not going to be the form ww. You're going to be out of the language. So I hope that's-- you've got a little practice with that. I think we're at our break. And I will see you back here in five minutes, if I can get my timer launched here. OK, so see you soon. This is a good time, by the way, to message me or the TAs. And I'll try to be looking for if you have any questions. In the pumping lemma, can x-- yeah, x can be epsilon in the pumping lemma. x can be epsilon. y can be epsilon, but x and y cannot both be epsilon, because then, when you pump, you'll get nothing new. Technically, v and y can include both 0's and 1's. Yeah, v and y can include both 0's and 1's. So let me try to put that back, if that's will-- so v and y can have both 0's and 1's, but they can't have 0's from two different blocks. And you can't have 1's from two different blocks. So what's going to happen is either you're going to get things out of order when you repeat-- like, a v has both 0's and 1's in it. When you repeat v, you're going to have 0's and 1's, and 0's and 1's, and 0's and 1's. That's clearly out of the language, so that's no good. Your only hope is to have v to be sticking only inside the 0's and y to be sticking only inside 0's or only inside 1's. But now, if you repeat that and just look at what you're going to get, you're going to have a string which is going to be-- if you try to cut that string in half, it's not going to be of the right form. It's not going to be two copies of the same string, because it's going to have a run of 0's followed by a longer or shorter run of 0's, or a run of 1's followed by another run of 1's of unequal length. So there is no way this can be two strings, two copies of the same string, because that's what you required. F has to be two copies of the same string to be in the language. OK, let me just see where-- we're running out of time here. Let me just put my timer here. We've only got 30 seconds. And I'm sorry I'm not getting to answer all the questions here. OK, we are done with our break. It's going to come back. And now we're shifting gears in a major way, because in a sense, everything we've",

    "question": "How can we use a path tree to solve the reachability problem in a graph?",
    "answer": "is called depth-first search, which doesn't do that, but rather, starts with its first vertex and just starts walking all the way out until it can't do that anymore. And then it kind of backtracks. That's one way to think about it. And so somehow, in breadth-first search, we're like, drawing concentric circles. In depth-first search, we're doing the opposite. We're like, shooting outward until we reach the outer boundary, and then exploring the graph that way. OK. And these are sort of the two extremes in terms of graph search kind of techniques that are typically used under the basic building blocks for algorithms in graph theory. So in order to motivate and think about depth-first search, we're going to define a second problem, which is closely related to shortest path, but not exactly the same. And that's the reachability problem. So here I have the world's simplest directed graph. So the black things are the edges. And the circles are the nodes or the vertices. And I've marked one special node in blue. And his name is the source node. And now the question I want to ask is, what are all of the other nodes in my graph that I can reach by following edges-- directed edges-- starting with the source? So obviously, I can get to the node in the lower right, no problem. And of course once I get there, I can traverse and edge upward to get to that second green vertex. Notice that I was really sneaky and evil, and I drew edges in this graph that might make you think that the red node is reachable. The red one being on the upper left. I'm realizing now that for colorblind people, this isn't a great slide. But of course, because all the edges from the red vertex on the left here point out, I can't actually reach it from the blue source node. So the reachability problem is just asking, which nodes can I reach from a given source? Pretty straightforward, I think. Of course, there are many ways to solve this. Right? In fact, one way we could do it would be to use our previous lecture. We could compute the shortest path distance from the source to all the other nodes. And then what would the length of the shortest path from the source to an unreachable node be? Any thoughts from our audience here? Infinity. Thank you, Professor Demaine. Right. So in addition to this, of course, a totally reasonable question, thinking back to our shortest path lecture, there are sort of two queries we might make. Right? One is just what is the length of the shortest path? The other is like, what is the actual shortest path from the source to a given vertex? We can ask a very similar thing here, which is like, OK. You tell me that the green guy is reachable, but how? Give me a path as evidence or a certificate, if you want to be fancy about it. So in order to do that, just like last time, remember, we defined a particular data structure that was the shortest path tree. We can do something very similar here. In particular, this is like the extent of my PowerPoint skills here. If I have a reachability problem, I can additionally store-- I can decorate every node in my graph with one other piece of information, which is the previous node along some path from my source to that thing. Right? And just like last time, if I want to get an actual path from the source to w, what could I do? I can start with w and then just keep following those parent relationships until I get back to the source. Then if I flip the order of that list of vertices, I get a path from the source to the target that's valid. So this object is called a path tree, just like we talked-- or a parent tree, rather. Just like we talked about in our last lecture, there's no reason why this thing should ever have a cycle in it. It's certainly a tree. Right. So that's the basic reachability problem. And in addition to that, we can compute this object P, which is going to give me sort of information about how any given node was reachable. There's a slight difference between the parent tree that I've defined here and the shortest path tree, which I defined last time, which is, I'm not going to require that the shortest path I get-- oh, man-- the path I get when I backtrack along my tree P is the shortest path, it's just a path because for the reachability problem, I actually don't care. Like, I could have a weird, circuitous, crazy long path. And it still tells me that a node is reachable. Right. So that's our basic set up and our data structure. And now we can introduce a problem to solve reachability. Again, we already have an algorithm for doing that, which is to compute shortest paths. And remember that our shortest path algorithm from previous lecture took linear time and the size of the input. It took v plus e time. Now the question is, can we do a little better? The answer, obviously, is yes, because I just asked it, and I gave you this problem. OK. And here's a technique for doing that, which unsurprisingly, is a recursive algorithm. I'm going to swap my notes for my handwritten notes.",

    "question": "How can we use a path tree to solve the reachability problem in a graph?",
    "answer": "But of course, there's sort of many variations on that theme when we talk about shortest path or even just existence of a path. So these are three sort of model problems that we might solve on a graph. So the first one, which in this of course we're calling the single pair reachability, would be the idea that I take two vertices s and t on my graph g, and I ask you does there exists a path between s and t. So what would be the sort of extreme example where this problem may not always give back the answer yes? Somehow in our head, I think we think of all graphs as being connected. But a perfectly valid graph the way we've defined it would be like 10 vertices and no edges. This function would be very easy to code if that were the only graph you ever cared about. But any event, the existence of a path is already a query that takes a little bit of algorithmic thinking. We haven't figured out how to do that yet. Now another problem we can solve would be the shortest path. Given a graph and two vertices, we might say, well, how far apart are these vertices of my graph if I want to use the shortest possible distance from one to the other. Notice that I can use the second problem to solve the first one. Because what's the length of the shortest path between two vertices that don't have a path between them? Infinity or a shrug-- that's actually a totally valid answer. Yeah, that's right. So how could I implement the reachability code? Well, I could call my shortest path code, and it gives me infinity. Then I return no, it's not reachable. And if it gives me not infinity, I return yes. So remember that a key idea in an algorithms class is this idea of reduction. That I can use one function to solve another. So in case, if we can solve shortest path, then we can certainly solve the reachability problem by calling that piece of code. And then finally we could talk about single source shortest path. So notice now that there's only one input node here s-- so what this problem is saying is give me the length of the shortest path from s to every single other vertex in my graph. Does that makes sense? Like maybe I return a big array with all the information, every single shortest distance. So can we solve single pair shortest path using single source shortest path? Absolutely. I could take s in my single pair shortest path problem, compute the shortest path from s to literally everything else, and then throw away all of that information except the shortest path to t, and now I'm good. Now I haven't justified that this is the fastest possible way to solve that second problem, but at least it shows that if I can solve problem three I can also solve problem two. If I can solve from two I can also solve problem one. So in today's lecture, we're just going to worry about problem three. In other words, these things are sort of listed in increasing order of their difficulty. OK, so in order to think about the single source shortest path problem, we're going to make one additional construction. And this is an idea called the shortest path tree.

    "question": "What is the formula for calculating the minimum total difficulty from note t_i with starting finger f?",
    "answer": "okay so in in interactive proofs there are two parties um and i'm going to think about them as one of them is going to be the professor okay so the professor is going to play the role of the verifier in a sense but it's like that the one who checks um and uh the professor being kind of old and tired he's been teaching too long maybe can only operate in probabilistic polynomial time so the professor if wants to tell whether two graphs are isomorphic or not probabilistic polynomial time doesn't seem to be enough to tell whether two graphs are isomorphic or not because it seems to be a more than polynomial problem however the professor has um help it has an army of graduate students and the graduate students they're not limited uh in the same way the professor is the graduate students are young they are energetic they can stay up all night they know how to code so the graduate students have unlimited computational ability so that we're going to think of the graduate students playing the role of the approver because they're not they're not limited in their capabilities we'll assume the professor on the other hand is limited so the professor wants to know if the two graphs are isomorphic let's say whatever they are um can't do it by himself so he's going to ask his students to figure out the answer and report back now there's only one problem the professor knows that students uh well in the old days they'd like to party i guess these days they like to play on uh play computer games a lot and so they're not really that eager to spend all their time figuring out whether graphs are isomorphic so he's worried that the the students will just come up with some answer and figure that he won't be able to tell the difference so the professor does not trust the students it's not enough to he for the professor to give the problem to the students and just take any answer that they're going to give the professor wants wants to be convinced okay so um now how could the students convince the professor of the answer that they've really done the work and figured out whether the graphs are isomorphic or not well if the graphs are isomorphic if it turns out that the graphs were isomorphic and the students figure that out then life is good because what are they going to do to convince the professor they're going to hand over the isomorphism and show yeah i mean they are you know those graphs really are isomorphic and here's how the correspondence works professor can check oh yeah i i now not now i'm convinced but suppose the graphs were not isomorphic what are we going to do then um the students have figured out where after night else the professor wants wants to be convinced oh no what are we going to do well in fact we're going to engage the the professor and the students are going to engage in the following protocol dialogue what's going to happen is now you have to make sure you're you're this is critical to follow to understand this little part of the story here because it's really going to set the pattern for everything in today's and tomorrow and to today's lecture and the and the next lecture okay so we're going to engage in a following interaction between the students and the professor which is going to enable the students to convince the professor that the two graphs really are not isomorphic so how is that going to work this is a beautiful little uh thing by the way so the professor is going to take the two graphs and pick one of them at random because the two graphs g and h um let's say they're not they really are not isomorphic the professor doesn't know that for sure that's what the students claim the professor really wants to not be convinced that the students are right um so the professor's gonna pick one of the two at random randomly permute that uh that choice the one that he picked and hand it over to the students say okay here is one of those two graphs randomly scrambled then i'm going to ask the students which one did i pick okay now if the graphs were really not isomorphic the students can check whether that randomly scrambled graph is isomorphic to either g or to h it's going to be isomorphic to one or the other and then they students can figure it out and they say oh you picked g or no you picked h as the case may be the students can figure that out but if the graphs were isomorphic then that scrambled version of g or h could equally well have come from either of them and the students would have no way of knowing which one the professor picked so that there's nothing they could do which would be better than guessing so if we do that a bunch of times the professor picks at random sometimes secretly of course the picks the grip picks either g or picks h and the students get it right every time either the students are really doing the work and the graphs are really not isomorphic or the students are just incredibly lucky they're managing to guess right let's say a hundred times so how the the the professor randomly and secretly picks grh uses this uses its probabilism flips a coin just a two-sided coin and says okay sometimes if we're going to do g sometimes they're going to do h just completely at random picks one or the other and then with some more randomness gets finds a random permutation of the one that he picked and then sends that over to the students and say which one did it come from um i'm not sure okay so let's pause here let's let's make sure we all understand this because this is really important um so i'm getting a question here how do we i'm not sure what your question is um okay so let me just say yeah the professor's going to play the role the verifier the graduate students play they're all approver that's coming but i really want to understand this protocol here okay so how is the professor picking the graph skin if you're okay i don't you know picking the graphs at random you have just two graphs they're in part of the input uh the both the students and the professor can see the graphs and the professors are just picking one of them at random using a coin so i'm not sure i understand the question there could p and v engage in a protocol where the secretary is on the prover side instead the question of revealing the isomorphism i there is no why so i'm not sure i understand this question either um maybe we'll make this clear you know if for for this little illustration the professor doesn't know the graphs could be isomorphic or they could be not isomorphic and so uh the professor wants to be convinced either way whatever the students whatever answer the students come up with we're going to shift this into a problem about a um deciding a language next but right now i'm just trying to give a sense of the how the model works i want to move from this informal model and now i'm going to formalize that in terms of model which will be deciding a language okay so so the interactive proof system model we have two interacting parties a verifier which is probabilistic polynomial time playing played by the professor in the previous slide and the prover which is unlimited computational power played by the students in the previous slide both of them get to see the input which in the previous case well it could be for example the pair of graphs they exchange a polynomial number of polynomial size messages so the whole exchange including the verifier's own computation is going to be polynomial the only thing that's not not not included within the computational cost is the prover's work which is unlimited um after that the verifier after the interaction the verifier will accept or reject and we're going to define the probability that the verifier together with a particular approver ends up accepting as you look over the different possible coin tosses of the verifier which could lead to different behavior on the part of the verifier and therefore different behavior on the part of the approver so over all the different possibility possibilities for the verifiers computation we're going to look at the probability that the verifier with this particular approver ends up accepting and i've written it this way this is the probability of the verifier interacting with the prover accepts the input is just simply that um and so we're going to work through an example we're going to work through the previous example more precisely in a second the class ip for interactive proofs stands for it's the class of languages such that for some verifier and approver um for strings in the language the prover makes the verifier accept with high probability and here's the interesting part for strings not in the language the prover makes it except with low probability but every there's no prover which can make it except with high probability so there's no way to cheat if you think about it in the case of the graphic non-isomorphism there's nothing you know if if the graphs were really isomorphic and the students were trying to in a devious way prove through that protocol that they're not isomorphic they would fail because there's nothing they can do if the graphs were isomorphic then um when the verifier the the professor picks one or the other at random um and scrambles it the students would have no way of telling which one the professor did so no matter what kind of scheme they try to come up with they're going to be out of luck so it's no mat for any strategy for strings that are not in the language for any s any prover calling that p with a tilde to stand for a devious or crooked prover for any uh possibly crooked prover even that with working with the verifier is still going to end up accepting with low probability so strings in the language there's going to be an honest prover who just follows the protocol in the correct way which makes the verifier accept with high probability for strings not in the language every prover is going to fail to make it accept with high probability um okay so that i mean the way i like to think about it is that p tilde is a possibly crooked proverb which is trying to make the verifier accept when it shouldn't because the string is not in the language it's like you know it's like even you can think of this in the case of um satisfiability um you know you a crooked prover might try to convince of the verifier that the formula is satisfiable when it isn't by by somehow trying to produce a satisfying assignment but that's going to be impossible there's nothing any strategy can possibly work when the formula is not satisfiable if that's what the verifier is going to check it's going to be looking for that satisfying assignment okay and by the way this is we're not going to prove this but it's really going to be proved in the same way you can make that one third error that could that occurs here something very tiny by the same kind of repetition argument okay so let's see um so why can't the prover in the first case be crooked um the prover in the first case would could be crooked but that's not going to serve the purposes um you know what what we want to show um you think about it like we think about np for strings in the language there exists a certificate there is a proof that you're in the language so if somebody is going to not produce the proof that's irrelevant the question is if you look at the best possible case the best possible prover um you know who's going to be able we're asking does there exist a way to convince the verifier that the um string is in the language so it doesn't matter that there might be some other uh silly way that doesn't work we're just looking at the best possible way so the best possible way when you're in the language is going to end up with a verifier having high probability when you're not in the language the best possible way is still going to end up with low probability when when i talk about best possible i'm trying to maximize the probability that the verifier is going to end up accepting let's continue um not sure as clear as i would like but um maybe again we're going to we're going to stick with that example because this is a very uh helpful example and to try to understand the setup and uh so we're gonna i'm gonna revisit that previous example about non-isomorphism but now in the context of this thinking about as a language so we're going to take this non-isomorphism um uh yeah we're going to take the non-isomorphism problem and show that it's an ip so there's going to be a verifier together with approver which are going to make the verifier accept with high probability for strings in the language namely graphs not ice being isomorphic and nothing there's going to be no way to make the verifier except with high probability for strings out of the language therefore that's when the graphs are isomorphic okay um so the protocol is just gonna we're gonna repeat the following thing twice you know i said in the previous case do it a hundred times just to help us think about it but actually",

    "question": "What is the opinion about the possibility of proving P = NP or P \u2260 NP within 20 years?",
    "answer": "If you compare these two classes, P and NP. P, first of all, is going to be a subset of NP, both in terms of the way we defined it because, deterministic machines are a special case of non-deterministic machines. But also if you want to think about testing membership, if you can test membership easily then you can certainly verify it in terms of the certificate. You don't even need it. The certificate is irrelevant at that point. Because whatever the certificate is, you can still test yourself whether the input is in the language or not. The big question, as I mentioned, is whether these two classes are the same. So does being able to verify membership quickly, say with one of these certificates, allow you to dispense with the certificate? Not even need a certificate and just test it for yourself whether you're in the language. And do that in polynomial time. That's the question. For a problem like Hamiltonian path, do you need to search for the answer if you're doing it deterministically? Or can you somehow avoid that and just come up with the answer directly with a polynomial time solution? Nobody knows the answer to that. And it goes back, at this point, quite a long time. It's almost 60 years now. That problem has been around 60 years. No, that would be 50 years. No, 50 years, almost 50 years. Most people believe that P is different from NP. In other words, that there are problems in P-- in NP which are not in P. A candidate would be the Hamiltonian path problem. But it seems to be very hard to prove that. And part of the reason is, how do you prove that a problem like Hamiltonian path does not have a polynomial time algorithm. It's very tricky to do that, because the class of polynomial time algorithms is a very rich class. Polynomial time algorithms are very powerful. And to try to prove-- there's no clever way of solving the Hamiltonian path problem. It just seems to be beyond our present day mathematics. I believe someday somebody's going to solve it. But so far, no one has succeeded. So what I thought we would do is-- I think I have a check-in here.",

    "question": "What does the GNFA conversion process involve with respect to the states?",
    "answer": "So now we're going to jump in and start doing the conversion. So we're going to have a lemma, which is like a theorem that really is just of local interest here. It's not a general interest theorem. It's going to be relevant just to GNFA, which are really just defined to help us do this conversion. They really don't have any other independent value. So every-- you want to show that every GNFA has an equivalent regular expression R. That's really my goal. And the way we're going to prove that is by induction. It's going to be by induction on the number of states of the GNFA. Now, you really should be familiar with induction as one of the expectations for being in this course. But in case you're a little shaky on it, don't worry. I'm going to unpack it as a procedure. It's really just recursion. You know, induction is just-- a proof that uses induction is really just a proof that calls itself. It's just a proof that-- it's a recursive proof. That's all it is. So if you're comfortable with recursion, you'll be comfortable with induction. But anyway, I'm going to describe this as a procedure. So if you're a little shaky on induction, don't worry. So the basis is-- so first I'm going to handle the case where the GNFA has just two states. Now, remember, I'm assuming now my GNFAs are in the special form. So you can't even have a GNFA with one state, because it has to have a start state and it has to have an accept state, and they have to not be the same. So the smallest possible GNFA to worry about is a two-state GNFA. Now, if we have a-- if we happen to have a two-state GNFA, it turns out to be very easy to find the equivalent regular expression. Why? Because that two-state GNFA can only look like this. It can have a start state, it can have an accept state, and it can only have a transition going from the start to the accept because no other transitions are allowed. It only has outgoing from the start, only incoming from the-- to the accept. And so there's only one transition. And it has a label with a regular expression R. So what do you think the equivalent regular expression is for this GNFA? It's just simply the one that's labeling that transition, because that tells us when I can go from the start to the accept. And there's nothing else the machine can do. It just makes one step, which is to accept its input if it's described by that regular expression. So therefore, the equivalent regular expression that we're looking for is simply the label on that single transition. So two-stage GNFAs are easy. But what if-- what happens if you have more states? Then you're going to actually have to do some work. So we call that the induction step. That's when we have more than two states. And what that-- the way the induction works is we're going to assume we already know how to do it for k minus 1 states. And we're going to use that knowledge to show how to do it for k states. So in other words, we already know how to do it for two states. I'm going to use that fact to show how to do it for three states, and then use the fact that I can do it for three states to show how to do it for four states, and so on, and so on. And the idea for how to do that is actually pretty easy to grasp. What we're going to do is, if we have a k state GNFA that we want to convert, we're going to change that k state GNFA to a k minus 1 state GNFA and then use our assumption that we already know how to do the k minus 1 state GNFA. So in terms of a picture, I'm going to take a k state-- to prove that I can always convert k state GNFAs to regular expressions, I'm going to show how to convert the k state one into an equivalent k minus 1 state GNFA. And then, if you just like to think of this procedurally, the k minus 1 gets converted to a k minus 2, gets converted to a k minus 3, and so on, and so on, until I get down to two, which then I know how to do directly. So the whole name of the game here is figuring out how to convert a GNFA that has k states into another one that has one fewer state that does the same language. So you have to hold that in your head. I mean, I wish I had more blackboard space here, but it's very limited here. So you have to remember what we're going to be doing on the next slide, because that's going to finish the job for us. As long as I can show in general how to convert a K, state GNFA to a GNFA that has one fewer state but it still does the same language, I'm good, because then I can keep iterating",

    "answer": "I called it a flexible greedy primarily because of this key function over here. So you'll notice in red there's a parameter called keyfunction. That's going to be-- map the elements of items to numbers. So it will be used to sort the items. So I want to sort them from best to worst, and this function will be used to tell me what I mean by best. So maybe keyfunction will just return the value or maybe it will return the weight or maybe it will return some function of the density. But the idea here is I want to use one greedy algorithm independently of my definition of best. So I use keyfunction to define what I mean by best. So I'm going to come in. I'm going to sort it from best to worst. And then for i in range len of items sub copy-- I'm being good. I've copied it. That's why you sorted rather than sort. I don't want to have a side effect in the parameter. In general, it's not good hygiene to do that. And so for-- I'll go through it in order from best to worst. And if the value is less than the maximum cost, if putting it in would keep me under the cost or not over the cost, I put it in, and I just do that until I can't put anything else in. So I might skip a few because I might get to the point where there's only a few calories left, and the next best item is over that budget but maybe further down I'll find one that is not over it and put it in. That's why I can't exit as soon as I reach-- as soon as I find an item that won't fit. And then I'll just return. Does this make sense? Does anyone have any doubts about whether this algorithm actually works? I hope not because I think it does work. Let's ask the next question. How efficient do we think it is? What is the efficiency of this algorithm? Let's see where the time goes. That's the algorithm we just looked at. So I deleted the comment, so we'd have a little more room in the slide. Who wants to make a guess? By the way, this is the question. So please go answer the questions. We'll see how people do. But we can think about it as well together. Well, let's see where the time goes. The first thing is at the sort. So I'm going to sort all the items. And we heard from Professor Grimson how long the sort takes. See who remembers. Python uses something called timsort, which is a variant of something called quicksort, which has the same worst-case complexity as merge sort. And so we know that is n log n where n in this case would be the len of items. So we know we have that. Then we have a loop. How many times do we go through this loop? Well, we go through the loop n times, once for each item because we do end up looking at every item. And if we know that, what's the order? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. JOHN GUTTAG: N log n plus n-- I guess is order n log n, right? So it's pretty efficient. And we can do this for big numbers like a million. Log of a million times a million is not a very big number. So it's very efficient. Here's some code that uses greedy. Takes in the items, the constraint, in this case will be the weight, and just calls greedy, but with the keyfunction and prints what we have. So we're going to test greedy. I actually think I used 750 in the code, but we can use 800. It doesn't matter. And here's something we haven't seen before. So used greedy by value to allocate and calls testGreedy with food, maxUnits and Food.getValue. Notice it's passing the function. That's why it's not-- no closed parentheses after it. Used greedy to allocate. And then we have something pretty interesting. What's going on with this lambda? So here we're going to be using greedy by density to allocate-- actually, sorry, this is greedy by cost. And you'll notice what we're doing is-- we don't want to pass in the cost, right, because we really want the opposite of the cost. We want to reverse the sort because we want the cheaper items to get chosen first. The ones that have fewer calories, not the ones that have more calories. As it happens, when I define cost, I defined it in the obvious way, the total number of calories. So I could have gone and written another function to do it, but since it was so simple, I decided to do it in line. So let's talk about lambda and then come back to it. Lambda is used to create an anonymous function, anonymous in the sense that it has no name. So you start with the keyword lambda. You then give it a sequence of identifiers and then some expression. What lambda does is it builds a function that evaluates that expression on those parameters and returns the result of evaluating the expression. So instead of writing def, I have inline defined a function. So if we go back to it here, you can see that what I've done is lambda x one divided by Food.getCost of x. Notice food is the class name here. So I'm taking the function getCost from the class food, and I'm passing it the parameter x, which is going to be what? What's the type of x going to be? I can wait you out. What is the type of x have to be for this lambda expression to make sense? Well, go back to the class food. What's the type of the argument of getCost? What's the name of the argument to getCost? That's an easier question. We'll go back and we'll look at it. What's the type of the argument to getCost? AUDIENCE: Food. JOHN GUTTAG: Food. Thank you. So I do have-- speaking of food, we do have a tradition in this class that people who answer questions correctly get rewarded with food. Oh, Napoli would have caught that. So it has to be of type food because it's self in the class food. So if we go back to here, this x has to be of type food, right. And sure enough, when we use it, it will be. Let's now use it. I should point out that lambda can be really handy as it is here, and it's possible to write amazing, beautiful, complicated lambda expressions. And back in the good old days of 6001 people learned to do that. And then they learned that they shouldn't. My view on lambda expressions is if I can't fit it in a single line, I just go right def and write a function definition because it's easier to debug. But for one-liners, lambda is great.",

    "question": "What does it mean for relaxation to be safe?",
    "answer": "just talking about the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm. OK. Correctness follows from two main observations. So the claim here that we're trying to prove is that d of s equals the delta s-- so the estimates equal the shortest-path distance is at the end of Dijkstra for all v and V at end. And this is going to follow from two observations. So the proof here, first, if ever relaxation sets d of s of v-- it sets the estimate equal to the shortest-path distance, if it ever does that, I argue to you that still true at end. OK, that's not a very strong statement. This is saying if I ever set the distance estimate to the true distance, I'm never going to set it to a different value later on. And why is that? Well, relaxation only ever decreases the distance. Relaxation only decreases d s, v. But we proved in lecture 11-- so two lectures ago that relaxation is safe. And what does safe mean? Safe means that relaxation-- that relaxation will only ever change these distant estimates to be either infinite-- it was never-- there was never a path to my vertex. Or it was the length of some path to v. Length of some path. OK. So what does that mean? It only decreases, but it's always the length of some path to v. So if this is the length of the shortest path to v, I could never set it to a smaller length, because there are no paths with shorter distance. That's the whole point. OK. So with this observation, I'm going to argue this final claim. It suffices to show that my estimate equals the shortest distance when v is removed from the Q. And since I removed every vertex from the Q in this while loop, I will eventually said to all of the distance estimates to the real distance and we'll be golden. Happy days. All right. So we'll be done if we can prove that statement. All right. So we're going to prove this by induction obviously. Induction on first k vertices removed from the Q. So the Q, we're popping vertices from this Q in some order. So I'm going to just argue that this claim is true for the first k. Clearly that's true for k equals 1. Base case, k equals 1. What is k equals 1? That means the first word vertex that I pop has this property, which is definitely true, because we set the shortest distance to s to be 0. That's all good. Now we have our inductive step. Assume it's true for k prime-- sorry, k less than k prime. And let's let v prime be k prime vertex popped. v prime. OK. And now let's look at some shortest path from s to v prime. So we got the shortest path from s to v prime. It exists. v prime is accessible. Let's say we pruned our graph to be only the things accessible from s so that, yeah, there exists the shortest path to v prime. And now let's think about these vertices. Some of them were removed from the Q and some of them were not. s was definitely removed from the Q. But some of these other vertices might not be. I want to be able to induct on this path, in particular, the vertex before me so that I can say that when I removed it and I relax the edge to v prime, then we're all golden. But that might not be the case. There could be a vertex, the vertex preceding me in the graph in this shortest path that was not popped from Q. I need to argue that it was or some other thing. So let's consider the first vertex in this path from s to v. I'm going to call it y, I think. Yeah. A vertex y that is not in Q. After I pop v prime, this is the first-- or before I pop v prime, y is not in the Q. Now these might be the same vertex if all of the preceding ones on this path were in the Q. But in particular, we're going to look at this guy. And say its predecessor's x in the path. Well what do I know? I know that x is in the queue. Everything here was popped from the Q-- not in. Which means that by induction, the shortest-path distance was set here correctly. So that the distance estimate at y can't be bigger than the shortest path to x plus w x, y. But this is on the shortest path to y, because the subpaths of shortest paths or shortest paths. So this has to equal d s, y, the distance to y. So actually, y is all good here. And so if v prime were y, we'd be done. That's the same argument is DAG relaxation. But we need to prove something about v prime. Well, because we have non-negative weights, the distance to v prime has to be at least as big as this distance, because it's a subpath. So this has to be less than or equal to the true distance to v prime. Because of negative-- non-negative weights, because the weights are non-negative. But because relaxation is safe, we know that our distance estimate for v prime has to be at least the shortest-path distance. This is because it's safe. This is-- weights are greater than or equal to 0. The last step here is that because we're popping the minimum from our priority queue, the thing with the smallest shortest-path distance, this has to be less than or equal to the shortest-path distance estimate to y. Because this is the smallest among all such vertices in my Q. But these are the same value. So everything between here is the same value. In particular, the estimate here is equal to my true shortest-path distance, which is exactly what we're trying to prove. OK, so that's why Dijkstra's correct. I'm going to spend the last five minutes on the running time of Dijkstra. We set this up so that we did everything in terms of these Q operations. Right so we have these Q operations, we have three of them. I'm going to say if I have a build operation, let's say it takes B time; to lead min, I'm going to say it takes M time; and this decreased key,",

But that might not be the case. There could be a vertex, the vertex preceding me in the graph in this shortest path that was not popped from Q. I need to argue that it was or some other thing. So let's consider the first vertex in this path from s to v. I'm going to call it y, I think. Yeah. A vertex y that is not in Q. After I pop v prime, this is the first-- or before I pop v prime, y is not in the Q. Now these might be the same vertex if all of the preceding ones on this path were in the Q. But in particular, we're going to look at this guy. And say its predecessor's x in the path. Well what do I know? I know that x is in the queue. Everything here was popped from the Q-- not in. Which means that by induction, the shortest-path distance was set here correctly. So that the distance estimate at y can't be bigger than the shortest path to x plus w x, y. But this is on the shortest path to y, because the subpaths of shortest paths or shortest paths. So this has to equal d s, y, the distance to y. So actually, y is all good here. And so if v prime were y, we'd be done. That's the same argument is DAG relaxation. But we need to prove something about v prime. Well, because we have non-negative weights, the distance to v prime has to be at least as big as this distance, because it's a subpath. So this has to be less than or equal to the true distance to v prime. Because of negative-- non-negative weights, because the weights are non-negative. But because relaxation is safe, we know that our distance estimate for v prime has to be at least the shortest-path distance. This is because it's safe. This is-- weights are greater than or equal to 0. The last step here is that because we're popping the minimum from our priority queue, the thing with the smallest shortest-path distance, this has to be less than or equal to the shortest-path distance estimate to y. Because this is the smallest among all such vertices in my Q. But these are the same value. So everything between here is the same value. In particular, the estimate here is equal to my true shortest-path distance, which is exactly what we're trying to prove. OK, so that's why Dijkstra's correct. I'm going to spend the last five minutes on the running time of Dijkstra. We set this up so that we did everything in terms of these Q operations. Right so we have these Q operations, we have three of them. I'm going to say if I have a build operation, let's say it takes B time; to lead min, I'm going to say it takes M time; and this decreased key,",

JOHN GUTTAG: Today we're starting a new topic, which is, of course, related to previous topics. As usual, if you go to either the 60002 or the 600 web site, you'll find both today's PowerPoint and today's Python. You'll discover if you look at the Python file that there is quite a lot of code in there. And I'll be talking only about some of it. But it's probably all worth looking at. And a fair amount of reading associated with this week. Why are we looking at random walks? See a picture here of, think of them as molecules just bouncing around. This is actually a picture of what's called Brownian motion, though Robert Brown probably did not discover it. We're looking at random walks because, well, first of all, they're important in many domains. There are people who will argue, for example, that the movement of prices in the stock market is best modeled as a random walk. There was a very popular book called A Random Walk Down Wall Street that made this argument. And a lot of modern portfolio analysis is based upon that. Those of you who are not interested in making money, and I presume that's most of you, it's also very important in many physical processes. We use random walks, say, to model diffusion, heat diffusion, or the diffusion of molecules in suspension, et cetera. So they're very important in a lot of scientific, and indeed, social disciplines. They're not the only important thing, so why are we looking at those? Because I think it provides a really good illustration",

    "question": "How can subtree properties in binary trees be efficiently maintained when nodes are added or removed?",
    "answer": "then how is it happening in constant time? Wouldn't it be happening [INAUDIBLE]?? ERIK DEMAINE: Why is this-- OK, good question. So one natural way, you can think of this as a recursion, which gives you a recursive algorithm. So I wrote-- but didn't write it. But I could have written size of node equals this-- size of node.left plus-- and that would give you a linear time algorithm to count the size. And if you don't have any information, that is what you would do. And that would be very painful. So that would make this algorithm really slow. If I'm calling size as a recursive function, it's bad. What I'm instead doing is storing the sizes on every single node and pre-computing this. So in fact, I'm going to define the size of node in-- so this is the definition mathematically. But the algorithm for this function is just going to be return node.size. So that's constant time. So the challenge now is I have to keep these sizes up to date, no matter what I do to the tree. And you could look back at last lecture and see, OK, what were all the changes that I did in a tree? We only did changes during insert and delete. And I will just claim to you, when we did insert and delete, what they ended up doing in the end, they add or remove a leaf of the tree. Remember, a leaf was a node with no children. So let's just think about if I add a new leaf in a tree-- here's a tree, suppose I add a leaf here-- which subtrees change? Well, which subtrees contain that node? It is its own new subtree. Then it's in its parent subtree, and its grandparent subtree, and the overall subtree. In general, these nodes are called the ancestors of this node that we added. And those are the ones that update. This subtree over here didn't change. It didn't change size. And because it's a subtree property, no subtree property will change over here, because the subtree was untouched. So when I touch this guy, I just have to update the subtree property here, update the subtree property here, update subtree property here. How many of these are there? Yeah? h-- I'll say order h to be safe. But I think it's exactly h. So also, when I remove a leaf, the same thing-- if I remove this leaf, then the subtrees that change are exactly its former ancestors. Cool, so we're going to update those order h ancestors in order up the tree. So what do I mean by update? I mean apply this rule. For size, it's this rule. But in general, the subtree property gives me an update rule that takes constant time. And so I'm going to apply that update rule to this node, which will fix whatever property is stored in there. Maybe there's more than one property. And then I'll apply it to this node. And because this is already correct by induction, and this is already correct because I didn't touch this subtree-- it's unchanged-- then I can update the value at this node-- the property at this node in constant time. Then I update this one. And because this one is already correct by induction, and this one is already correct because this subtree is unchanged, I can update the property correctly here in constant time. So when I make a change in order h time, because I'm making h calls to this constant time algorithm, I can update a constant number of subtree properties. This is very powerful. Data structure augmentation is super useful. You will use it on your problem set. We will use it again today. Let me give you some examples of subtree properties. They could be-- common ones are, like, the sum, or the product, or the min, or the max, or sum of squares, or all sorts of things, of some feature of every node in the subtree. In fact, subtree size is an example of such a thing. It is the sum over all nodes in the subtree of the value 1. It's another way to say count the number of nodes. But you could also say, what's the sum of the keys in these nodes? Or you could say, what's the maximum key in these nodes? Or you could say, what is the maximum value in these nodes? You can take any property. It doesn't have to be key. It doesn't have to be anything in particular. It's very powerful. You can take all sums, products and maintain them as long as they're downward looking-- as long as you're only thinking about the subtree. Some examples of things you cannot maintain are-- not a nodes index. So if you get a little bit too excited about augmentation, you might think, oh, I could do everything. I needed to support subtree_at, or let's just say, get_at globally, I wanted to know what is the ith node in my tree? Well, I'll just use data structure augmentation and store in every node what is its index, 0 through n minus 1. I can't maintain that efficiently. Because if I insert at the beginning of my traversal order, then all the indices change. So that's an example of a edit. So if I insert a new node over here, so this guy's index was 0, now it's 1. This guy's index was 1, now it's 2. This was 2, now it's 3, and so on. Every node changes its index. Index is not a subtree property, and that's why we can't maintain it. Because it depends on all of the nodes in the tree. Or it depends on all the nodes to its left-- all the predecessors. ",

    "answer": "on how many nodes are over here on the left, which is not in the subtree of that node. So that's where you have to be careful. Don't use global properties of the tree. You can only use subtree properties. Another example is depth. Depth Is annoying to maintain, but it's not obvious why yet. We will see that in a moment. The rest of today is about going from order h order log n, which is what this slide is showing us. So at this point, you should believe that we can do all of the sequence data structure operations in order h time-- except for build and iterate, which take linear time-- and that we can do all of the set operations in order h time, except build and iterate, which take n log n and n respectively. And our goal is to now bound h by log n. We know it's possible at some level, because there are trees that have logarithmic height. That's like this perfect tree here. But we also know we have to be careful, because there are some bad trees, like this chain. So if h equals log n, we call this a balanced binary tree. There are many balanced binary trees in the world, maybe a dozen or two-- a lot of different data structures. Question?

    "answer": "Let's go on from there. So let's do a couple of examples. Here, again, is that same-- getting to be an old friend, that automaton M1. Remember, its language here is the set of strings that have the substring 11. That is that language A. Now, what do we know about A from the previous slide? Think with me. Don't just listen. A is a regular language now, because it's recognized by some automaton. So whenever you find an automaton for a language, a finite automaton for language, we know that that language is a regular language. So let's look at a couple of more examples. So if you take the language-- let's call this one B, which is the strings that have an even number of 1's in them. So like the string 1101, would that be in B? No, because it has an odd number of 1's. So the string 1111 has four 1's in it. That's an even number, so that string would be in B. The 0's don't matter for this language. So strings that have an even number of 1's, that's a regular language. And the way you would know that is you would have to make a finite automaton that recognizes that language. And I would encourage you to go and make that automaton. You can do it with two states. It's a very simple automaton. But if you haven't had practice with these, I encourage you to do that. And actually, there are lots of examples that I ask you to solve at the end of chapter 1 in the book, and you definitely should spend some time playing with it if you have not yet seen finite automata before. You need to get comfortable with these and be able to make them. So we're going to start making some of them, but we're going to be talking about it at a sort of a more abstract level in a minute. Basically, the reason why you can solve this problem, you can make a finite automaton which recognizes the language B, is because that finite automaton is going to keep track of the parity of the number of 1's it's seen before. This has two states, one of them remembering that it's seen an odd number of 1's so far, the other one remembering it's seen an even number of 1's before. And that's going to be typical for these automata, finite automata. There's going to be several different possibilities that you may have to keep track of as you're reading the input, and there's going to be a state associated with each one of those possibilities. So if you're designing an automaton, you have to think about-- as you're processing the input-- what things you have to keep track of. And you're going to make a state for each one of those possibilities. OK? So you need to get comfortable with that. Let's look at another example, the language C where the inputs have an equal number of 0's and 1's. That turns out to be not a regular language. So, in other words, what that means is there's no way to recognize that language with a finite automaton. You just can't do it. That's beyond the capabilities of finite automata. And that's a statement we will prove later. OK. And our goal over the next lecture or so is to understand the regular languages, which you can do in a very comprehensive way.",

Continuing in our whirlwind tour of interesting geometry classes here at MIT, I have some more fun things to add to the list. And we'll introduce some of the ideas in the next couple of slides here.",

    "question": "What are the core concepts in graph-theoretic models?",
    "answer": "OK, here we go. So I'm just going to give a reduction. That's what the definition means. I'm going to give a way of converting formulas to pairs, a G and a k, where the formula's going to be satisfiability if and only if the graph has a k-clique. OK, so let's a little bit do it by example. And in order to do that-- so here's going to be a formula now. It's in 3CNF. That's what I need in order to be doing this reduction. I'm converting 3CNF formulas into clique problems. We to have a little bit understand what it means when we say-- we talk about the satisfiability of a formula like this, because it's going to be helpful in doing the reduction. Obviously, satisfiability means that the-- you can find an assignment to the variables. So you're going to set each of these variables-- A, B, and C, and so on-- to true or false, and you want to make the whole formula evaluate the true. But what does that actually mean? It means that, because of the structure of the formula, that making this formula true corresponds to making each clause true-- because the clauses are all anded together, so the only way for the formula to be true is to make each clause true. And to make a clause true, you have to make at least one of the literals true. So it's another way of thinking about satisfying this formula. Satisfying these [INAUDIBLE] satisfying assignment makes at least one true literal in every clause. It's really important to think about it that way, because that's what's going to be the basis for doing this reduction and all of the reductions. It's what makes 3SAT easy to think about, in terms of its satisfiability. If you had a general satisfiability problem and you had a satisfiability both formula, there's no obvious way of seeing what the satisfying assignment looks like, but here we understand what it looks like. It has that very special form, making one true literal in every clause-- at least one true literal in every clause. So now we're going to do the reduction. So I'm going to take from this formula-- I know, for some of you, you're going to be chafing. Why am I going slowly? But I want to make sure that we're all together and understanding what the rules of the game are and what we're trying to do. We're trying to convert this formula into a graph and a number. So right now my job is, to do this reduction, is to exhibit that graph. So I'm going to do that and two steps. First, I'm going to tell you what the nodes of the graph are. Then I'll tell you what the edges of that graph [AUDIO OUT] Finally, I'll tell you what the number k is. That's the way this polynomial time reduction is going to work. And we have to also observe at the very end that the reduction that I'm given-- giving you, this procedure for building this graph can be done in polynomial time, but that, I think-- you'll see, once I'm done, that that's pretty obvious. OK, so first, as I promised, the nodes-- so the nodes of this graph are going to correspond to the literals of the formula. Every literal is going to become a node in the graph, and it's going to be labeled with the name of that literal. Every node is going to be labeled an a, a b, or c bar, and so on. So here it goes.",

    "question": "What is a rejecting computation history?",
    "answer": "It's going to help me in the coming slides because they're a little bit dense. When I'm going to draw this sort of reddish, pinkish box around something, that means that I'm going to try to describe all strings except for that one. I want to avoid describing that one, because that's the rejecting computation history, but I want to describe everything else. That's my wish. So here's a check in before we move forward. But we can also-- maybe we should just take some questions, even before we launch the check in. How are we doing here? So, is our one describing-- well, R1 is a regular expression. Over here, we're talking about a-- this is just an ordinary computation history, but it ends with a reject. That's all. A rejecting computation history is just one that's a little different at the end. The machine just ended up rejecting instead of accepting. Otherwise everything has to be spelled out in accordance with the rules of the machine and the start configuration. Yeah, we were assuming one rejecting state. Yeah, that's the way we actually define Turing machines in the first place. But, who's arguing. Yeah, there's one reject state. We're all deterministic, correct. Why do we need the padding? Because I want to make these all the same size, all of these configurations. That's going to help me later in terms of describing the invalid configurations, the ones that are not legal configurations, legal rejecting configurations. So just simply a matter of convenience, but just accept it for now. I just want all of those configurations to be the same length in my rejecting computation history. Otherwise I'm not going to-- I'm just coding that rejecting computation history in this particular way. So people are asking about the details of bad start. That's yet to come. I have two more slides on this. So I'll tell you about how we're going to do those. So R bad-start-- that's a good question-- is R bad-start all-- these are all the strings that don't start this way. We'll see it in a second. But R bad-start are all the things that don't start with the-- they start bad. They're not starting with the start configuration. They're starting with some other junk. Do we need only one rejecting computation history? What about the other ones? This is a deterministic machine, so there's only going to be-- if I prescribe the lengths as I've done, there's going to be only one rejecting computation history. Because it's deterministic, everything is going to be forced from the beginning. Should R1 be the not of those three? No. R1 is describing all of the strings except, except this one string. So I'm capturing all the different possible ways a string could fail to be the string. It could start wrong. Could be wrong along the middle somewhere. So I have to union them together. Because I'm describing-- as I always believe, negations are the most confusing thing to everybody, including me. So we're describing all the things that are not this string. We're trying to stay away from that one. We want to describe everything else. All right, I think I'd better move on here. We've got a lot of questions. Talk to the TAs. All right, check in. How big is this rejecting computation history anyway? Interesting. There's a lesson here. I got a big burst of answers right at the very beginning. All wrong. But then the bright-- the people who took a little bit more time to think started getting the right answer, which is-- let's look. We've got a close election here folks, so now I have to report. Hope we don't have to do a recount. OK, come on guys. Answer up. 10 seconds. This is not super hard. Stop the count. Yeah, I think we'd better stop at this, we're on the edge. OK, 3 seconds. End polling. Share results. The correct answer is, in fact, c. Why is that? Because each configuration is 2 to the n to the k. So that's how much space the machine has, exponential space. But the amount of time, which is each one-- the number of configurations is going to be the amount of time that's used. It's going to be exponentially more even than that. So it's going to be 2 to the 2 to the n of the k, is how many steps the machine can run. And that's going to be how long the computation history could be. So it's a very long thing. And when you think about it, the regular expression we are generating, how big is that? The regular expression-- again, a lot of people playing off my comments here. Were the votes legal or not? OK. Let's focus here. So this is doubly exponentially large. How big is the regular expression that we're generating? Well that has to be produced in polynomial time, so it's only polynomially big. So we have this little teensy weensy, relatively speaking, regular expression, which is only n to the k. It's having to describe all strings except for this particular string, which is 2 to the 2 to the n to the k. So in a sense, this string that is related to that regular expression is doubly exponentially larger than that. And that kind of presents some of the challenge in doing the reduction, in constructing that regular expression.",

    "question": "What is a rejecting computation history?",
    "answer": "using the arithmetization method. So first of all, arithmetization is a simulation of and and or with plus and times, such that if I think about true as a 1 and false as a 0, this is going to give me a faithful simulation. It's going to do the right thing. It's going to compute exactly the same values that we expect. So like a and b, well, times works just like and. It does for 1 and 0 as true and false, times exactly works like and. And negation is 1 minus. Or is going to be the sum minus the product. And then, these just give you the right values, a or b. If you just calculate it out by plugging in 1s or 0s, you get the right answer just by using this arithmetic. So now, what we're going to do, instead of using the Boolean labeling, we'll just use the arithmetical labeling. But it's going to compute exactly the same thing because the arithmetic simulates the Boolean. So we always go through the start node. So there's no question about labeling the very start node with a 1. But now, I'm going to give expressions just like the Boolean expressions, but now they're going to use plus and times instead of ands and ors. So let's just see. Remember what we did from before. We had a and xi for this edge. I'm going to replace that. What is and? We just look up here in our table, in our translation table. And becomes times. So we're going to replace that with a times xi. And it's going to work exactly the same. But the difference is that this makes sense even when we have non-Boolean values. Times and plus are defined for non-Boolean values, whereas ands and or are not. So what goes down on this edge? Well, this was a and the complement of xi, as you remember. So that's going to become a times 1 minus xi. And then similarly, we had or over here. And here's a little bit of a trick, but that's going to be important for the analysis that we're going to do. Instead of using the recipe for or in terms of plus and times, we're going to have something a little simpler. It's just going to be the sum. And the reason why that works-- good to understand-- is that because of the acyclic nature of the branching programs, at most, one of these edges can have a path through it. So this is a kind of very special or, sometimes called the disjoint or. You're not allowed to have more than one of the values be 1, because that never happens when you have an acyclical graph. You can never have the path coming down this way, and then, again, coming down that way. Then it would be entering that node twice. Have to be a cycle. So it's going to be good enough for us, and necessary for us to represent this or as a sum. OK. So I think that's all I wanted to say on this slide. So somebody is asking, is it possible for some of these values to be negative? Yes. As it stands right now, some of these values can be negative. I haven't put any restriction on what the values are going to be. So the input could be a negative number. And then, you're going to just get negative stuff happening. In fact, there's subtractions going on here. So even with positive numbers-- I think we did an example last time. I think I'm going to do that example again of exclusive or, where you get negative numbers coming up. That doesn't matter. But actually, what we're going to end up doing is doing these calculations modulo some prime number q. OK. I'm going to pick some prime like 17, and do all the calculations mod 17. And the reason for doing it that way is really because we're going to be picking random assignments to the variables as our input. And it makes the most sense to do that when you have a finite set of possibilities to pick them up. So we're not going to pick like a random integer. There's infinitely many possibilities. And yeah, you could set up a distribution there, but that's very complicated. That actually might work. I'm not sure. I haven't actually gone through that analysis. But the typical way people do this is by looking at what's called a finite field. So I'll talk about that in a second. Why is there at most one 1 among a1, a2, and a3? The 1s-- I'll say once again-- but the 1s correspond to the path. So this is a 1 if the path went this way. Just think about it. The path cannot go through a1 and can, at the same time, go through a2, because that means the path went through this node. Then, how is it going to get over to a2? It's going to go through that node twice. In an acyclic graph, you cannot have a path going through it's the same node more than once. So you're going to have to think about that.",

So let's just survey briefly the things that we've already-- languages that we've already seen, which are NP-complete.",

    "answer": "Any questions about this or about machine learning in general? If so, this would be a good time to ask them, since I'm about to totally change the topic. Yes? AUDIENCE: At what level does AUROC start to be statistically significant? And how many data points do you need to also prove that [INAUDIBLE]? JOHN GUTTAG: Right. So the question is, at what point does the AUROC become statistically significant? And that is, essentially, an unanswerable question. Whoops, relay it back. Needed to put more air under the throw. I look like the quarterback for the Rams, if you saw them play lately. So if you ask this question about significance, it will depend upon a number of things. So you're always asking, is it significantly better than x? And so the question is, is it significantly better than random? And you can't just say, for example, that 0.6 isn't and 0.7 is. Because it depends how many points you have. If you have a lot of points, it could be only a tiny bit better than 0.5 and still be statistically significant. It may be uninterestingly better. It may not be significant in the English sense, but you still get statistical significance. So that's a problem when studies have lots of points. In general, it depends upon the application. For a lot of applications, you'll see things in the 0.7's being considered pretty useful. And the real question shouldn't be whether it's significant, but whether it's useful. Can you make useful decisions based upon it? And the other thing is, typically, when you're talking about that, you're selecting some point and really talking about a region relative to that point. We usually don't really care what it does out here. Because we hardly ever operate out there anyway. We're usually somewhere in the middle. But good question. Yeah? AUDIENCE: Why are we doing 1 minus specificity? JOHN GUTTAG: Why are we doing 1 minus specificity instead of specificity? Is that the question? And the answer is, essentially, so we can do this trick of computing the area. It gives us this nice curve. This nice, if you will, concave curve which lets us compute this area under here nicely if you were to take specificity and just draw it, it would look different. Obviously, mathematically, they're, in some sense, the same right. If you have 1 minus x and x, you can get either from the other. So it really just has to do with the way people want to draw this picture. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]? JOHN GUTTAG: Pardon? AUDIENCE: Does that not change [INAUDIBLE]? JOHN GUTTAG: Does it not-- AUDIENCE: Doesn't it change the meaning of what you're [INAUDIBLE]? JOHN GUTTAG: Well, you'd have to use a different statistic. You couldn't cite the AUROC if you did specificity directly. Which is why they do 1 minus. The goal is you want to have this point at 0 and this 0.00 and 1.1. And playing 1 minus gives you this trick, of anchoring those two points. And so then you get a curve connecting them, which you can then easily compare to the random curve. It's just one of these little tricks that statisticians like to play to make things easy to visualize and easy to compute statistics about. It's not a fundamentally important issue.",

    "question": "What is the runtime complexity of the merge function in merge sort?",
    "answer": "So if we do our runtime in two minutes or less-- bare with me guys-- well, what is this merge function going to do? Well, in some sense, there's two branches. There's an if statement with two pieces. But both of those pieces call merge with one fewer piece in it. So in some sense, we have s of n equals s of n minus 1 plus theta of 1, which we already know from our previous proof means that s of n is equal to theta of n. So in other words, it takes linear time to merge. It makes sense intuitively because essentially you're touching every one of these things once with your two fingers. And now, probably the hardest part of the lecture, which I left zero time for, is deriving the runtime for the actual merge sort algorithm. And what does that look like? Well, that one's a little bit trickier because, of course, I call the merge sort algorithm twice, each time on a list that's half the size. In this class, we're going to assume that our list is always a power of 2 in its length. Otherwise, this analysis is a itty bitty bit more of a headache. So first of all, how long does it take to sort an array of length 1? I am not going to ask hard questions. Everybody? Yeah, it's just 1, right? Because there's nothing to do. An array of length 1 has one element and it's sorted. It's also the biggest element and the smallest element. And now, what does our algorithm do? Well, it makes two recursive calls on lists that are half the length. And then it calls that merge function. And we know that the merge function takes theta of n time. Does that make sense? So one thing we might do, because we have some intuition from your 6042 course, is that we think that this thing is order n log n because it makes the two recursive calls. And then it puts them together. And let's double check that that's true really quick using the substitution method. So in particular, on the left-hand side here, maybe I have cn log n. Now, I have 2 c. Well, I have to put an n over 2 log n over 2 plus theta of n. And I want to double check that this expression is consistent. I've got about a foot to do it in. So remember-- let's see. If we use our favorite identities from high school class that you probably forgot, remember that log of 2 things divided by each other is the difference of the logs. So this is really 2. OK. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So this is c times n times log n minus log of 2 plus theta n. I'm already out of time. But notice that there's a c n log n on the right-hand side. There's a c n log n on the left-hand side. So those two things go away. And what am I going to be left with? I'm going to be left with theta of n equals cn log of 2. Notice that c and log 2 are both constants. We have a theta event on the left-hand side. So there's order in the universe. And we've derived our runtime. So I know I rest a little bit through merge sort. I'm sure that Erik and Jason can review this a little bit next time. But with that, we'll see you, what? Thursday and Friday. And it's been a pleasure to talk to you all.",

    "answer": "So what do the leaves actually represent? Those represent outputs. I'm going to output something here. Yep? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: The number of-- OK. So what is the output to my search algorithm? Maybe it's the-- an index of an item that contains this key. Or maybe I return the item is the output-- the item of the thing I'm storing. And I'm storing n things, so I need at least n outputs, because I need to be able to return any of the items that I'm storing based on a different search parameter, if it's going to be correct. I actually need one more output. Why do I need one more output? If it's not in there-- so any correct comparison searching algorithm-- I'm doing some comparisons to find this thing-- needs to have at least n plus 1 leaves. Otherwise, it can't be correct, because I could look up the one that I'm not returning in that set and it would never be able to return that value. Does that make sense? Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: What's n? For a data structure, n is the number of things stored in that data structure at that time-- so the number of items in the data structure. That's what it means in all of these tables. Any other questions? OK, so now we get to the fun part. How many comparisons does this algorithm have to do? Yeah, up there-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: What's up? All right, your colleague is jumping ahead for a second, but really, I have to do as many comparisons in the worst case as the longest root-to-leaf path in this tree-- because as I'm executing this algorithm, I'll go down this thing, always branching down, and at some point, I'll get to a leaf. And in the worst case, if I happen to need to return this particular output, then I'll have to walk down the longest thing, just the longest path. So then the longest path is the same as the height of the tree, so the question then becomes, what is the minimum height of any binary tree that has at least n plus 1 leaves? Does everyone understand why we're asking that question? Yeah? AUDIENCE: Could you over again why it needs n plus 1 leaves? JASON KU: Why it needs n plus 1 leaves-- if it's a correct algorithm, it needs to return-- it needs to be able to return any of the n items that I'm storing or say that the key that I'm looking for is not there-- great question. OK, so what is the minimum height of any binary tree that has n plus 1-- at least n plus 1 leaves? You can actually state a recurrence for that and solve that. You're going to do that in your recitation. But it's log n. The best you can do is if this is a balanced binary tree. So the min height is going to be at least log n height. Or the min height is logarithmic, so it's actually theta right here. But if I just said height here, I would be lower bounding the height. I could have a linear height, if I just changed comparisons down one by one, if I was doing a linear search, for example. All right, so this is saying that, if I'm just restricting to comparisons, I have to spend at least logarithmic time to be able to find whether this key is in my set. But I don't want logarithmic time. I want faster. So how can I do that? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: I have one operation in my model of computation I presented a couple of weeks ago that allows me to do faster, which allows me to do something stronger than comparisons. Comparisons have a constant branching factor. In particular, I can-- if I do this operation-- this constant time operation-- I can branch to two different locations. It's like an if kind of situation-- if, or else. And in fact, if I had constant branching factor for any constant here-- if I had three or four, if it was bounded by a constant, the height of this tree would still be bounded by a log base the constant of that number of leaves. So I need, in some sense, to be able to branch a non-constant amount. So how can I branch a non-constant amount? This is a little tricky. We had this really neat operation in the random access machine that we could randomly go to any place in memory in constant time based on a number. That was a super powerful thing, because within a single constant time operation, I could go to any space in memory. That's potentially much larger than linear branching factor, depending on the size of my model and the size of my machine. So that's a very powerful operation. Can we use that to find quicker? Anyone have any ideas? Sure. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JASON KU: We're going to get to hashing in a second, but this is a simpler concept than hashing-- something you probably are familiar with already. We've kind of been using it implicitly in some of our sequence data structure things. What we're going to do is, if I have an item that has key 10, I'm going to keep an array and store that item 10 spaces away from the front of the array, right at index 9, or the 10th index. Does that make sense? If I store that item at that location in memory, I can use this random access to that location and see if there's something there. If there's something there, I return that item. Does that make sense? This is what I call a direct access array.",

    "question": "What is the definition of a negative-weight cycle in a graph?",
    "answer": "cycles, we'd be done. I claim to you a stronger statement, that if the shortest path using at most V edges from s to v Is less than-- strictly less than delta of V minus 1-- this is all in the subscript here. Basically this is the shortest-path distance of any simple path, and possibly ones that also contain cycles, but definitely it includes all the simple paths. If there's a shorter path to my vertex that goes through more than V minus 1 edges, that this path can't be simple, because it goes through a vertex more than once. Otherwise it would be included in this distance set. So if this is the case, and I found a shorter path to V that uses v edges-- yeah, that use V edges, that path can't be simple, which means that path or some path there contains a negative weight cycle. So if this is true, then I know that the real shortest-path distance from S to V must be minus infinity. I'm going to call such a vertex a witness. If we can find a vertex that has this property-- I mean, I haven't shown you how to compute these things yet, but if I were able to find a vertex V-- and these are capital V's if you're having trouble. This V is different than this V, this is cardinality. If we can find such a vertex V, that certifies that there is a negative weight cycle in our graph. So I'm going to call V is a witness. OK. So, if this property is true, it's a witness and it definitely has this. Is it possible, you think-- I'm going to claim to you that it's possible that a vertex could have minus infinite distance but not have this property halt. I could probably give you an example-- I don't have one off the top of my head right now, but that's possible. You could imagine, there might be no path going to a vertex on a negative weight cycle that goes through V exactly V edges. It might go through more edges, a shorter one. So this equation would be inequality and would not certify that this is true. But I claim to you, if a vertex has this property, if it's its shortest path distances minus infinite, then it must be reachable from a witness. So that's the claim. If delta S, V is minus infinity, then V is reachable from a witness. Reachable from a vertex that has this property-- that has this property. And if it's reachable from something that has minus infinity shortest pathway, then I can take that path go to my reachable vertex, and that's also minus infinite path. OK. So how do we prove this? Well, let's consider-- let's I'm going to state a somewhat stronger statement that we'll prove instead. It suffices to prove that every negative weight cycle contains a witness. If we are to prove that, then every vertex with this property, every vertex with this property is reachable from a negative weight cycle by definition. So, if we can prove that every-- prove every negative weight cycle contains witness. If we can prove that every negative weight cycle contains a witness, then every vertex reachable from one of those witnesses-- in particular, reachable from the negative weight cycle-- has shortest distance minus infinity, and that should prove the claim. This thing has to be reachable from a negative weight cycle. And so if we prove negative weight cycles contain witnesses, then all of these vertices are reachable from a witness. OK, great, great. Confusing myself there for a second. OK. So let's consider a negative weight cycle. NG. Here's a directed negative weight cycle. Recall. This will be my negative weight cycle C. All of the sum of the edges in this thing, the weights has negative weight. And I'm going to have a little bit notation-- if I have a vertex V here, I'm going to say that its predecessor in the cycle, I'm just going to call it V prime. That's just some notation. All right. So, if I have computed these shortest-path distances to every vertex in my graph, shortest-path distance going through at most V vertices and the shortest path distance going through at most V minus 1 vertices, then I know the following thing holds. Delta V going from S to V for any vertex in my cycle can't be bigger than delta V minus 1 from S to U plus the weight-- sorry, not U-- V prime, its predecessor, plus the weight going from the predecessor to my vertex. Why is that? Why is that? Because this is the weight of some vertex-- this is the weight-- the shortest-path distance to my predecessor using one fewer edge. And so this in particular is the weight of some path that uses V edges. So if this is the shortest such path distance, this has to upper bound it at least-- at most. Yeah? AUDIENCE: Is that the triangle inequality? JASON KU: That is a statement of the triangle inequality, thank you. All right. So, yes, this is just by triangle inequality. OK. Now what we can say is, let's take this equation summed over all vertices in my cycle. So I'm just going to add summation here of all vertices in my cycle of this whole thing. I'm going to do that out a little bit neater. Summation of delta, not d. Delta V S, V. I guess I don't need this open parentheses. Equals-- or less than or equal to sum of V and C of delta V minus 1 V prime. And here, I'm summing over V and C, and this is just my notation for the predecessor. And then I'm going to sum over the weights in my cycle V and C. These are the sum of the weights in my cycle. Well, what do I know about this cycle? This is just the weight of C. The weight of C-- that's awful handwriting. C, what do I know about the weight of the cycle? It's negative. So, this is less than 0, which means that if I remove this, this needs to be a strict equality. But if the sum of all of these is strictly less than the sum of all these, we can't have none of the vertices in my graph satisfying-- not satisfying this property. If all of them are not witnesses, then this thing is bigger than this thing-- at least as big as this thing for every vertex in my cycle, which is a contradiction. So, the claim holds, if we have a negative infinite shortest-path distance, then V is reachable from a witness. So it suffices for us to find all the witnesses, find all the vertices reachable from the witnesses, and then mark them as minus infinity. Does that make sense? OK. So, now we finally are able to get to our algorithm. Bellman-Ford. And what I'm going to show you today is a little different than what is normally presented as Bellman-Ford. The original Bellman-Ford algorithm does something a little different. And because it does something a little different, which we'll talk about at the end, it's a little hairier to analyze. I'm going to show you a modification that is a little easier to analyze and has this nice property that we're going to be able to use the algorithm to give us a negative weight cycle if it exists. So, we're going to say this is maybe a modified Bellman-Ford.",

    "question": "What is the definition of a negative-weight cycle in a graph?",
    "answer": "And there is a natural ambiguity that comes up in a programming language. If you have if some condition then statement one, else statement two, I presume you understand what the semantics of that is, what that means. And the tricky thing is that if you have-- those statements can themselves be if statements. And so if you have the situation where you have if then and if then else is what follows that, the question is, where does the else attach? Is it to the second if or to the first if? So that's kind of a big hint on this problem, but that's OK. You need to take that and figure out how to get an actual member of the language which is ambiguously generated, and then show that it has-- show that it is by showing two parse trees or two leftmost derivations. If you read the book, you'll see that's an alternative way of representing a parse tree. So and then what you're supposed to do is give a grammar for the same language which is unambiguous. You don't have to prove that it's unambiguous, because that's a bit of a chore. But as long as you understand what's going on, you should be able to come up with an unambiguous grammar which resolves that ambiguity. And I don't have in mind changing the language by introducing new programming language constructs like a \"begin end.\" That's not in the spirit of this problem, because that's a different-- it's grammar for a different language. So you need to be generating the same language without any other extraneous things going on that are going to resolve the ambiguity. The ambiguity needs to be resolved within the structure of the grammar itself. So keep that in mind. For problem number three about the queue automata, you know, that came up actually as a suggestion last lecture, I believe, or two lectures back. What happens if you take a pushdown automaton, but instead of a pushdown-- instead of a stack, you add a queue. What happens then? Well actually, it turns out that the model you get is very powerful. And it turns out to be equivalent in power to a Turing machine. So you'll see arguments of that kind today, how you show that other models are equivalent-- no, not today. So I apologize. This is going to be something that you'll-- I'm confusing myself here. Problem number three actually needs Thursday's lecture as well to really at least see examples of how you do that kind of thing. Yeah, so I'll try to send out a note clarifying this. By the end of Thursday, you'll be able to do everything, except for problem six. And for problem six, you'll need Tuesday's lecture, a week from today's lecture, to do. So problem number four, that one you'll be able to do at the end of today. That's also going to-- the problem is I'm working on preparing Thursday's lecture too. So I'm getting a little-- I'm confusing myself. Problem number four, you'll be able to do after Thursday's lecture. Maybe we should talk about that next lecture. Problem number five, you can do today, but maybe I'm not going to say anything about that. And problem number six, I won't say anything about either. OK, so why don't we just jump in then and look at today's material. What about seven? Oh, seven is an optional problem. Oh, I should have mentioned that. Seven is always going to be an option. I indicate that with a star I should have made that clear on the actual description here, but seven is optional. It's just like we had for problem set one. OK, let's move let's move on, then, to what we're going to talk about today. And just a little bit of review-- so we talked about the equivalence of context-free grammars and pushdown automata, as you remember. Oops, let me get myself out of the picture here. As we mentioned last time, we actually proved one direction, but the other direction of that, you just have to know it's true, but you don't have to know the proof. The proof is a little bit lengthy, I would say. It's a nice proof, but it's pretty long. And there are two important corollaries to that. If you know what a corollary is, it's just a simple consequence which doesn't need much of a proof, sort of a very straightforward consequence. First of all, I think we pointed out last time, one conclusion, one corollary you get is that every regular language is a context-free language, because a finite automaton is a pushdown automaton that just happens not to use its stack. So immediately, you get that every language is context free. And second of all, you also immediately get that whenever you have a context-free language and a regular language and you take their intersection, you get back a context-free language. So context free intersect regular is context free. That's actually mentioned in your homework as well as one of the 0.x problems which I give to try to get you-- you don't have to turn those in, but I suggest you look at them. I don't know how many of you are looking at them. But this is a useful fact. And some of those other facts in 0.x problems are useful. So I encourage you to look at them. But anyway, intersection of context free and regular is context free. You might ask, what about intersection of context free and context free? Do we have closure under intersection? The answer is, no, we do not have close to closure under intersection.",

    "answer": "So here's the polynomial time algorithm. You construct the graph, you accept if there's a path from the start to the accept, and you reject if there is not. And so that tells us that not only is L contained within NL, but NL itself is also contained within P. So here's a kind of a nice hierarchy of languages. Not only do we not know whether L equals NL, we don't know whether L equals P. It's possible that anything you can do in polynomial time, you can do deterministically in log space, shocking as that might be, because this is a pretty weak class. But we don't know how to prove that there's anything different, anything in P that's not in here. Last check in. So we showed that PATH is in NL. What's the best thing we can do about the deterministic space complexity of PATH? So deterministic. So this is nondeterministic log space. What can we say deterministically about PATH? Hint-- this should not be hard if you think back to what we've shown very recently. Get your check in points. Closing up. Closing shop here. All set, 1, 2, 3. Yeah, so the correct answer is log squared space, because this is just Savitch's theorem. We can do it in log space nondeterministically, so you can do it in log squared space deterministically. So this is what we did today. And as I mentioned, I will do this again on Tuesday's lecture, just to recap that. All right, so I'll stick around a little bit for questions. And someone's asking me about the nomenclature. Why is it L and not L space? Because people don't usually talk about L time. So L is sort of-- everybody knows the only reasonable option is space, so people just say L and NL. I mean, some of these names have a little bit evolved over time. And even now, some people talk about-- I call \"time classes,\" some people call \"detime classes.\" You can make different choices there. Let's see. Good.",

    "question": "How can the parent node index be computed from a given left or right child node index in a binary heap stored as an array?",
    "answer": "basically means no pointers, just an array of the n items. How are we going to get away without storing pointers? I'd still like to treat it like a tree. I'd still like to know the left child of B is D and the right child B is E. We'll see why in a moment. Well, we can do this with index arithmetic. So maybe I should add some labels before I get there. So this array naturally has indices. This is index 0. This is index 1, index 2, index 3, index 4, index 5, index 6, 7, 8, 9, because there are 10 items, 0 through 9. And I can apply those labels up here, too. These are the same nodes, so 0, 1, 2. This is just a depth order. But once I have this labeling, it's going to be a lot easier to figure things out. So if I wanted to know the left child of B is D, somehow, given the number 1, I want to compute the number 3. Add 2, there are all sorts-- multiply by 3, there are all sorts of operations that take 1 and turn it into 3. But there's only one that's going to work in all cases. And the intuition here is, well, I have to 2 the i nodes at level i. If I want to go to the child level, there's 2 to the i plus 1 nodes down there-- exactly double. So it's the very last one, but that won't really matter. If there is a left child, it will behave the same. And so, intuitively, I have this space of size 2 to the i. I have to expand it to a space of size 2 to the i plus 1, So I should multiply by 2. And that's almost right, but then there's some constants. So I'd like to say 2 times i. But if we look at the examples here, 1 times 2 is 2, which is 1 less than 3. 2 times 2 is 4, which is 1 less than 5. Hey, we almost got it right. It's just off by 1. Off by 1 is-- index errors are the most common things in computer science. What about the right child? If the left child is a 2i plus 1, where is the right child? I hear lots of mumbles. 2i plus 2-- one more. Because we're writing things left to right in depth order, the right child is the right sibling of the left child. So it's just one larger, OK? Given those rules, we can also compute parent. It's just whatever is the inverse of both of these functions, which I want to divide by 2 at some point. I want to get back to i given 2i plus 1 or given 2i plus 2. And so if I subtract 1 from i, then I either get 2i or 2i plus 1. And then, if I take an integer division by 2, I get i-- the original i. Sorry, maybe I'll call this j to be clearer. So j is the left or right child. Then I can reconstruct i, which was the parent. So this is constant number arithmetic operations. So I don't have to store left and right pointers. I can just compute them whenever I need them. Whenever I'm at some node like E, and I want to know what's its left child-- sorry, given the node index 4, which happens to contain the item E, and I want to know what's its left child, I just multiply by 2 and add 1. I get 9. And then, I can index into this array at position 9. Because I don't-- this is just in my head, remember. We're just thinking that there's a tree here. But in reality, on the computer, there's just the array. So if we want to go from E to J, we can, from 4 to 9. If we go try to go to the right child, we multiply by 2. 8 add 2-- 10. And we see, oh, 10 is beyond the end of the array. But our array stores its size, so we realize, oh, E does not have a right child. This is something you can only do in a complete binary tree. In a general binary tree you don't have these nice properties. Cool, so this is basically a heap. I just need to add one more property, naturally called the heap property.",

    "question": "How can the parent node index be computed from a given left or right child node index in a binary heap stored as an array?",
    "answer": "All right. So we construct this graph G prime. We can do that in linear time with respect to these things. I just go through all the edges, I make these edges, and I make these vertices. It doesn't take anything-- I just do it naively. Right I can do that in time V times V plus E asymptotically. OK. Now I run DAG relaxation, our nice algorithm we had last time, from-- in there was a0. I'm going to say it's S0, our source. Our source vertex. Single source shortest paths. So that I compute delta of S0 to Vk for all k and-- what is it? 0 to V. That's what single source shortest paths does. It computes for me this distance from my source-- at some source to every other vertex in the graph. And so in particular I get these. Well, that is all of them. Then for each vertex V, set-- the thing I'm going to return, d-value, S to V, equal to the shortest-path distance I got from DAG relaxation to a particular vertex. V V minus 1. Why am I doing this? I'm setting it to be the shortest-path distance to the guy in the second-to-last row here or column in my modified graph. The hope is that this distance in my DAG corresponds to this distance in my original graph. The distance to V using at most V minus 1 edges. So that's the claim-- that's a claim we're going to prove in just a second. I'm going to write it down just so that we have-- just to continue our train of thought. Claim, delta S0 Vk equals delta k, the k edge distance, from S to V. That's what we want to claim. That would then-- what would that mean, then? That would mean that I'm correctly setting the shortest-path distance here for all vertices whose distances finite. Great. I mean, I set values to things where they're not finite, where they're minus infinity also, but in particular I set the ones correctly if they're finite. OK. So the last thing we need to do is deal with these minus infinity vertices. But we know how to do that. We just look at the witnesses. Because we've computed this value for k equals V equals V minus 1, and if that claim over there is true, then those shortest-path distances are the same as these k edge shortest-path distances. And we can just, for every vertex, we compare these things. If this is satisfied, we got a witness. OK. So for each witness U and V where delta S0 U V is less than, strictly, S0 U V minus 1-- that's the definition of a witness here, close the parentheses. Then for each vertex V reachable from U set-- sorry, d, is what we're returning, d of S, V equal to minus infinity. That's the end of the algorithm. Basically I'm looking for all the witnesses. For each witness, I find all of the vertices reachable from it and set it to minus infinity just as we argued before. OK. So, it remains to prove this claim. How do we prove this claim? Well, we can induct on k. Is this true for k equals 0? Yeah. We kind of already argued it over here when we are talking about our initialization step or what DAG relaxation does. It'll set this to be the shortest path from this guy to all these vertices. These aren't reachable from here, and so these are infinite.",

    "question": "What is the difference between an interface and a data structure?",
    "answer": "Fairly simple data structures today. This is the beginning of several data structures we'll be talking about in the next few lectures. But before we actually start with one, let me tell you/remind remind you of the difference between an interface-- which you might call an API if you're a programmer, or an ADT if you're an ancient algorithms person like me-- versus a data structure. These are useful distinctions. The idea is that an interface says what you want to do. A data structure says how you do it. So you might call this a specification. And in the context of data structures, we're trying to store some data. So the interface will specify what data you can store, whereas the data structure will give you an actual representation and tell you how to store it. This is pretty boring. Just storing data is really easy. You just throw it in a file or something. What makes it interesting is having operations on that data. In the interface, you specify what the operations do, what operations are supported, and in some sense, what they mean. And the data structure actually gives you algorithms-- this is where the algorithms come in-- for how to support those operations. All right. In this class, we're going to focus on two main interfaces and various special of them. The idea is to separate what you want to do versus how to do it. Because-- you can think of this as the problem statement. Yesterday-- or, last class, Jason talked about problems and defined what a problem was versus algorithmic solutions to the problem. And this is the analogous notion for data structures, where we want to maintain some data according to various operations. The same problem can be solved by many different data structures. And we're going to see that. And different data structures are going to have different advantages. They might support some operations faster than others. And depending on what you actually use those data structures for, you choose the right data structure. But you can maintain the same interface. We're going to think about two data structures. One is called a set and one is called a sequence. These are highly loaded terms. Set means something to a mathematician. It means something else to a Python programmer. Sequence, similarly. I guess there's not a Python sequence data type built in. The idea is, we want to store n things. The things will be fairly arbitrary. Think of them as integers or strings. And on the one hand, we care about their values. And maybe we want to maintain them in sorted order and be able to search for a given value, which we'll call a key. And on the other hand, we care about representing a particular sequence that we care about. Maybe we want to represent the numbers 5, 2, 9, 7 in that order and store that. In Python, you could store that in a list, for example. And it will keep track of that order. And this is the first item, the second item, the last item. Today, we're going to be focusing on this sequence data structure, although at the end, I'll mention the interface for sets. But we're going to be actually solving sequences today. And in the next several lectures, we'll be bouncing back and forth between these. They're closely related. Pretty abstract at the moment. On the other hand, we're going to have two main-- let's call them data structure tools or approaches. One is arrays and the other is pointers-- pointer-based or linked data structures. You may have seen these. They're used a lot in programming, of course. But we're going to see both of these today. I'll come back to this sort of highlight in a moment. Let's jump into the sequence interface, which I conveniently have part of here. There's a few different levels of sequences that we might care about. I'm going to start with the static sequence interface. This is where the number of items doesn't change, though the actual items might. Here, we have n items. I'm going to label them x 0 to x n minus 1, as in Python. So the number of items is n. And the operations I want to support are build, length, iteration, get, and set. So what do these do? Build is how you get started. To build a data structure in this interface, you call build of x. Exactly how you specify x isn't too important, but the idea is, I give you some items in some order. In Python, this would be an iterable. I'm going to want to also know its length. And I want to make a new data structure of size and a new static sequence of size n that has those items in that order. So that's how you build one of these. Because somehow, we have to specify n to this data structure, because n is not going to be allowed to change. I'm going to give you a length method. Methods are the object-oriented way of thinking of operations that your interface supports. Length will just return this fixed value n. Iter sequence. This is the sense in which we want to maintain the order. I want to be able to output x 0 through x n minus 1 in the sequence order, in that specified order that they were built in or that it was changed to. This is going to iterate through all of the items. So it's going to take at least linear time to output that. But more interesting is, we can dynamically access anywhere in the middle of the sequence. We can get the ith item, x i, given the value i, and we can change x i to a given new item. OK. So that's called get_at and set_at. Pretty straightforward. This should remind you very closely of something-- a data structure. So this is an interface. This is something I might want to solve. But what is the obvious data structure that solves this problem? Yeah? AUDIENCE: A list. ERIK DEMAINE: A list. In Python, it's called a list. I prefer to call it an array, but to each their own. We're going to use \"list.\"",

    "answer": "100,000, and a million. And what do we see as we look at this? Well, right away we can see that fair roulette is usually a much better bet than either of the other two. That even with only 1,000 spins the return is negative. And as we get more and more as I got to a million, it starts to look much more like closer to 0. And these, we have reason to believe at least, are much closer to true expectation saying that, while you break even in fair roulette, you'll lose 2.7% in Europe and over 5% in Las Vegas, or soon in Massachusetts. All right, we're sampling, right? That's why the results will change, and if I ran a different simulation with a different seed I'd get different numbers. Whenever you're sampling, you can't be guaranteed to get perfect accuracy. It's always possible you get a weird sample. That's not to say that you won't get exactly the right answer. I might have spun the wheel twice and happened to get the exact right answer of the return. Actually not twice, because the math doesn't work out, but 35 times and gotten exactly the right answer. But that's not the point. We need to be able to differentiate between what happens to be true and what we actually know, in a rigorous sense, is true. Or maybe don't know it, but have real good reason to believe it's true. So it's not just a question of faith. And that gets us to what's in some sense the fundamental question of all computational statistics, is how many samples do we need to look at before we can have real, justifiable confidence in our answer? As we've just seen-- not just, a few minutes ago-- with the coins, our intuition tells us that it depends upon the variability in the underlying possibilities. So let's look at that more carefully.

    "answer": "interface a little bit more. So our set is a container. It contains all of the students in this classroom, in some virtual sense at least. And so to build up our set, of course, we need an operation that takes some iterable object A and builds a set out of it. So in other words, I have all the students in this classroom represented maybe in some other fashion. And I have to insert them all into my set. I can also ask my set for how much stuff is in it. Personally, I would call that size. But length is cool, too. And then of course, there are a lot of different ways that we can interact with our set. So for instance, we could say, is this student taking 6.006? So in set language, one way to understand that is to say that the key-- each person in this classroom is associated with a key. Does that key k exist in my set? In which case, I'll call this find function, which will give me back the item with key k or maybe null or something if it doesn't exist. Maybe I can delete an object from my set or insert it. Notice that these are dynamic operations, meaning that they actually edit what's inside of my set. And then finally, there are all kinds of different operations that I might want to do to interact with my set beyond is this thing inside of it. So for instance, so for the student ID example, probably finding the minimum ID number in a class isn't a terribly exciting exercise. But maybe I'm trying to find the student who's been at MIT the longest. And so that would be a reasonable heuristic. I actually have no idea whether MIT student IDs are assigned linearly or not. But in any event, I could find the smallest key, the largest key, and so on in my set. And these are all reasonable operations to query, where my object is just",
